# Changelog

All notable changes to Tesserae are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions are
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0, so minors can carry breaking changes).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **M5Stack PaperMono hardware kind.** New `m5stack_papermono` kind for the
  3.97" 480x800 4-level greyscale handheld (Pro and Lite share it): the
  reTerminal Sticky's wire contract (`esp32_bw_client`, `gray_4`, a
  96000-byte 2-bpp frame from `esp32_gray2_bin` at the portrait stride the
  firmware transposes), paired with the `m5stack-papermono` target in
  tesserae-device-firmware. `auto_select: false` because it is
  indistinguishable on the relay wire from the Sticky and the Xteink X4
  gray build. Confirmed on real hardware the same day (portal, register,
  dashboard frame, battery telemetry) and added to the test matrix.
  The kind now also declares touch (FT6336G) with the usual `touch_enabled`
  / `touch_linger_s` knobs, and a `frontlight_pct` setting (0-100) for the
  panel's built-in frontlight, which the firmware hands to the board's
  power-management chip.
- Every bundled widget now translates its panel text. The 28 widgets that
  still painted hardcoded English (the Home Assistant set, clocks, countdown,
  year progress, todo, news, pictures, transit, status) moved their labels,
  empty states, legends and status words behind the widget `ctx.t()` contract
  with a generated `strings/en.json`, and the whole bundled set ships
  Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish,
  Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Chinese (Simplified and
  Traditional). The set follows where installs actually report from; the
  language pickers list all of them automatically. A repo-wide test now
  pins every widget's locales to its shipped files, the English key set to
  every translation, and each literal `t()` call to its English text.

### Fixed

- **Upgrading a catalog bundle removes the widgets it dropped.** When a
  new release of a bundle renames or drops a folder, the marketplace
  installer now deletes the old folder instead of leaving it behind as an
  untracked plugin that still loads against the new shared code and could
  never be uninstalled from the catalog page.

- A sleeping REST device woken for a daily lineup no longer collects the
  previous day's frame. The device was told to poll 20 s after the lineup's
  target, but the scheduler fires on a 30 s tick and renders each due lineup
  in turn, so most mornings the poll landed before the new frame existed. The
  miss then stuck: the projection reported the lineup as due now, a
  fraction of a second in the past once truncated to the second, and the
  poll path skipped it as stale and sent the device to sleep for its whole
  interval on the old frame. The scheduler margin is now 70 s, and a change
  overdue by less than a tick means "poll again after the margin".
- The Jarvis-Judice-Ninke and Stucki dithers no longer flood flat regions
  of a colour panel with a single colour. The numpy error-diffusion loop
  never bounded the value a pixel accumulated from its neighbours, so a
  field the palette cannot reach banked the same residual on every pixel
  and the wide kernels carried it into the next region as a solid swathe.
  The diffused value is now clamped to 0-255 before matching, as Pillow's
  Floyd-Steinberg does. Atkinson shifts imperceptibly.
- The Location picker on the weather, sky, and sunrise widgets now accepts a
  pasted `lat, lon` pair. It only ever asked the city name search, which
  returned "No matches." for coordinates, so a spot with no nearby town could
  not be saved from the editor (#302). The pair is offered as a pick, Enter
  takes it, and the Label auto-fills with the coordinates.
- Interval schedules whose page renders unchanged no longer re-fire every
  scheduler tick. A `no_change` push never recorded the fire, so a stable page
  paid a full render every 30 seconds and filled the History view; it now
  re-arms the interval like a sent push does.
- The canvas editor's in-browser preview now paints cached webfonts. It built
  its own font list from the bundled set, so a code element naming a cached
  family showed the fallback in the editor while the device push had the real
  face.

### Added

- The week calendar widget has a "Show daily event counts" toggle, so the
  per-day count chip under each date can be turned off to save header
  height. Event locations, when shown, now wrap to as many whole lines as
  fit inside the block instead of being cut to one ellipsised line.
- The weather_now, weather_now_scenic, weather_hourly and weather_forecast
  widgets now ship French, on the same `locales` contract as the calendar
  widgets: titles, legends, metric labels, WMO condition text and empty
  states go through `ctx.t()`, and the forecast's weekday abbreviations
  come from `Intl` in the panel's locale rather than a fixed English table.
- The Dashboards page has Active and Archived tabs. Archive parks a dashboard
  you're not using without deleting it: it keeps its layout, device links,
  and history, but leaves the "go to page" and lineup pickers, drops its
  Home Assistant entities, and skips the background refresh passes. Restore
  brings it back; Duplicate on an archived dashboard makes a working copy.
  Only a dashboard no lineup references can be archived, so the button is
  disabled on lineup members with the lineup named in its tooltip, and bulk
  archive skips them and says so.
- Hardware catalog entry for the original M5Stack M5Paper (pre-S3), the 4.7"
  960x540 16-level greyscale handheld on the classic ESP32-D0WDQ6-V3. Unlike
  the PaperS3 its glass is driven through an IT8951 controller over SPI, so it
  reuses the reTerminal E1003's `esp32_gray_bin` wire format at the PaperS3's
  geometry over the existing `esp32_client` protocol. Marked
  `auto_select: false` -- an M5Paper and a PaperS3 report the same model,
  gamut and scan on the wire, so relay pairing can't tell them apart and this
  kind is only ever set explicitly. Verified end-to-end on hardware
  2026-09-10: dashboard frame, battery telemetry, the three side buttons, the
  SHT30 sensor, and touch. `touch: true` with a `touch_enabled` /
  `touch_linger_s` form; the GT911 reports in composition space so taps
  hit-test directly, and it needs Stay awake because the classic ESP32 can't
  wake from deep sleep on the touch controller.
- Timed lineups take a display of their own. The setup wizard's "set time"
  and "keep fresh" modes now ask which display to send to, defaulting to
  every display the dashboard is on, so a dashboard shared by several
  panels can be scheduled for just one of them. The full schedule form
  gains the same picker, schedules carry `device_ids` through the
  Lineups view and the MCP schedule API, and the scheduler already
  honoured a bound timed lineup (discussion #300).
- Hardware catalog entries for the reMarkable 2, reMarkable 1 and reMarkable
  Paper Pro, driven by the community tesserae.remarkable AppLoad client over
  the v1 REST device API. The reMarkable 2 is confirmed on hardware; the
  other two are built from the same code paths and await confirmation.
- Dynamic `refresh_rate` on the TRMNL BYOS `/api/display` path. It echoed the
  static configured `refresh_rate_s`; now it runs the same next-poll decision
  the v1 REST path's `next_poll_s` has used since #241 — the configured rate is
  the ceiling, pulled earlier for the next projected dashboard change or a
  widget staleness hint, reshaped onto a wake-alignment grid, and stretched to
  sleep through a quiet window the device asked to sleep through (#299). A Kobo
  or Kindle running KOReader with "Use server refresh interval" enabled now
  wakes once at the end of quiet hours instead of every interval overnight. The
  shared decision moved into `app.device_poll`; a fault anywhere in it degrades
  to the static configured value.
- 16-level greyscale over TRMNL BYOS. A new `trmnl_png_gray16` renderer: the
  same fit / flip / underscan / contrast / dither pipeline as `trmnl_png`, but
  quantised to a 16-entry grey ramp and saved as an 8-bit greyscale PNG. For
  panels that paint real greys over the BYOS `/api/display` path, jailbroken
  e-readers running KOReader (confirmed on a Kobo Clara HD) and, untested, the
  Seeed reTerminal E1003 / TRMNL X 16-level waveform under TRMNL firmware,
  where 1-bit output turns every chart fill and shaded band into
  coarse error-diffusion speckle. Honours a device's measured grey ramp when a
  greyscale calibration profile is applied (same `_gray_ramp` side channel
  `esp32_gray_bin` reads). `trmnl_client` now lists both renderers.
- Renderer picker on the device card (Settings → Devices → General). Shown only
  when a device's kind offers more than one renderer of the same wire format
  that the extension-matching auto-select can't tell apart — today that is
  `trmnl_client` (1-bit `trmnl_png` vs 16-grey `trmnl_png_gray16`). Switching
  repins the instance and drops its stale render so the next poll re-renders.
- Any webfont in canvas pages and code elements, cached server-side. A new
  `add_font` MCP tool (`POST /api/mcp/fonts`) fetches a Google Fonts family by
  name at chosen weights and styles, or one face from a direct .woff2 / .ttf
  URL, once at author time; only the latin subset is kept unless asked
  otherwise, so a CJK family stays small. Cached families then work exactly
  like the bundled ones: autolibs inlines the face into a code element's
  sandbox when its CSS names the family, the page `font` field accepts the
  cached id, and the appearance catalog lists them with `source: "cached"`.
  Renders never touch the network; a missing cache entry degrades to the
  author's fallback stack. `list_fonts` and `delete_font` complete the set,
  and files are served from `/page-fonts/<id>/<file>` on the local origin.
- Hardware catalog entries for the paperlesspaper OpenPaper 7 (7.3" Spectra 6,
  800x480) and OpenPaper L (13.3" Spectra 6, 1200x1600) picture frames, both
  ESP32-C6 boards running the Tesserae device firmware over the existing
  `esp32_client` protocol and `esp32_bin` renderer. The L entry is marked as
  not yet confirmed on hardware.
- The OpenPaper 7 entry and the tested matrix now record the on-hardware
  confirmation.
- The OpenPaper 7 kind composes portrait (480x800) by default, matching the
  frame standing upright; the renderer rotates onto the panel's 800x480 native
  stride when packing. Confirmed upright on hardware with the USB-C port at
  the bottom.
- The GTFS widget gains a "GTFS-RT VehiclePositions URL" field, for agencies
  that publish vehicle positions as their own feed beside TripUpdates and
  ServiceAlerts. With "Show stops away" on, a row reads "2 stops" when the
  feed reports a stop sequence, and falls back to the straight-line distance
  from the stop ("1.4 km", or miles via the new "Distance units" option) when
  the feed only carries coordinates, which is all some agencies publish.
  Reports older than ten minutes are ignored. `gtfs` 0.12.0.
- The History widget gains a "Current value" option (#282). "Large headline
  above the chart" draws the single-sensor reading in display type with the
  trend arrow and low / high beside it, so a weather panel shows the value at a
  glance with the history underneath for context. The default keeps the value
  in the legend strip under the chart. `ha_history` 0.8.0.
- Quiet hours can be limited to chosen weekdays and can mark whole days quiet
  (#299). Both the app-level window and a device's override gain a "Window
  applies on" weekday picker and a "Quiet all day" picker, so an office panel
  can be quiet overnight on weekdays and all weekend. Each day is judged by its
  own clock: on a ticked day an overnight window covers that morning up to
  the end time and that evening from the start time. Existing settings keep
  their meaning: every day, no all-day days.
- "Sleep through quiet hours", off by default, tells battery panels to sleep
  until the quiet window ends instead of waking on their interval inside it.
  The REST status response stretches `next_poll_s` (and `wake_at`) to the end
  of the window, capped at six days; always-on panels are unaffected. Wake
  alignment now searches five days ahead so a quiet weekend does not push an
  aligned device back onto its plain interval.

- The Home Assistant History widget takes optional "Y-axis minimum" and
  "Y-axis maximum" cell options that pin the chart's value axis. Blank keeps
  the auto-fit range, and one side can be set on its own. The Sensor widget's
  description and sparkline help now point at the History widget for a full
  chart with labelled axes (#282).

### Fixed

- The Gallery's sequential rotation keeps a cursor per device (#209). Two
  panels showing the same folder used to share one position and advance it
  for each other, so a panel woken between the other's renders skipped
  photos. Each panel now walks the album at its own pace; the first render
  after upgrading carries on from the album's current position rather than
  restarting at the first photo, and a render with no device bound keeps the
  shared cursor it always had. The cursor file is named after the device, so
  deleting `.sequential_index_<folder>_<device>` restarts that one panel.
  Because the widget now declares `render.per_device_id`, a page carrying it
  is composed and captured once per bound device rather than once per panel
  group, in random mode as well. `picture_gallery` 0.1.3.
- Installing or removing a widget from Browse no longer shows "Install failed:
  network error" under the success message. The success branch throws while
  adding the topbar "Restart required" button (the topbar holds two theme
  toggles and it picked the drawer's, which isn't a direct child), and the
  request's error handler reported that as a network failure. The install had
  succeeded, but the restart button only appeared after a reload. The button
  now targets the topbar's own toggle, and the network-error message is
  reserved for a failed request.

- A device's last heartbeat now survives a server restart (#282). The battery,
  signal, temperature and humidity readings the status strip widget and the
  Devices card draw from lived only in memory, so after an upgrade they were
  blank until the device next reported, and a frame fetched on a button wake
  is rendered before that same wake's heartbeat lands. The last merged
  heartbeat is kept in `data/core/device_status.json` and seeds the cache at
  boot with its original timestamp, so the Devices card still shows the
  reading's real age.
- The History widget's low and high now always bracket its current value
  (#282). The current reading comes from the live state while low and high
  came from the history samples, which ha_core caches for longer, so a fresh
  reading could sit below the window's low. A live state newer than the last
  sample now joins the series as its final point, so the chart also ends where
  the headline says. `ha_history` 0.8.1.
- Min / max labels on the History widget's chart stay inside the canvas
  (#282). A maximum sitting on the top gridline lost its label off the top
  edge, and a marker at either end of the series lost half of it off the
  side. The chart now reserves room above the plot for the max label and
  keeps both labels within the drawing area, flipping a label to the other
  side of its point when it cannot fit.
- The self-hosted relay container now sends an explicit `Content-Length` on
  every response instead of chunked transfer encoding. ESP32 firmware reads a
  sealed frame only when the response carries a length, so a remote panel
  paired against a container relay stayed on "waiting for first frame" even
  though pairing and heartbeats worked. Relay image `0.1.1`.
- Older x86-64 processors (before 2009, no SSE4.2) no longer get a bare
  `Illegal instruction` from the Docker image: the entrypoint explains that
  the bundled numpy needs x86-64-v2 and points at the fix. The image accepts a
  `NUMPY_SPEC` build argument (`--build-arg NUMPY_SPEC='numpy<2.4'`) to pin the
  last numpy line whose wheels run on those machines, and the install docs
  carry the same note for a bare install.

### Added

- Hardware kind `waveshare_esp32_driver_75` for Waveshare's E-Paper ESP32 Driver
  Board carrying a 7.5" mono panel (V2, 800×480). Inherits `esp32_bw_client`
  and the 48000-byte mono frame shared with the reTerminal E1001 and the XIAO
  7.5" boards; firmware is the `waveshare-esp32-driver-75` build in
  tesserae-device-firmware. Not yet confirmed on real hardware.
- **Calendar Core** can use each event's own colour where the feed sets one.
  A per-feed toggle on the feed row opts in; RFC 7986 `COLOR` names and
  `X-APPLE-CALENDAR-COLOR` hex values are read, and an event with no colour of
  its own keeps the feed colour. Off by default, so existing feeds render as
  before. (#222)
- `GET /api/mcp/appearance` serves the theme, style and font lists. (#257)

### Changed

- PicPak frames now get the "update available" chip on the Devices card and
  the Firmware page. The update check (api.tesserae.ink) also follows
  community firmware repos, starting with `picpak_client` mapped to
  varanu5/picpak-tesserae-client. Such releases carry no OTA descriptor, so
  the chip links the release for a web-flasher update rather than queueing
  an over-the-air one.
- `/api/mcp/catalog` reports a count of themes, styles and fonts and points at
  the appearance endpoint instead of inlining the lists, taking roughly a
  sixth off every `list_widgets` read. (#257)
- **tesserae-mcp 0.16.0.** `list_widgets(section="appearance")` fetches the
  lists from the new endpoint, and the served tool docs point there. Upgrade
  with `pipx upgrade tesserae-mcp`; an older bridge returns counts where the
  docs promise lists.
- The device setup guide gains an *Update delivery* section describing Auto
  and Always full refresh.
- The `cryptography` dependency now allows the 50.x series, which carries the
  fix for PYSEC-2026-3552. The affected PKCS#7 API is not used here; the pin
  was the only reason the audit kept reporting it.

### Fixed

- **Background loops can be stopped as a set.** The scheduler, the
  relay-pairing poller, the OpenDisplay telemetry poller and HA discovery's
  ticker register with a small registry when they start, and the transport
  wiring keeps the two pollers threadless under the test suite. This is what
  the intermittent hour-long CI stall was: each test that built an app left a
  full set of these loops running, and the worker eventually wedged with a
  hundred of them alive. The suite now stops them after every test and fails
  the test that leaks one.
- **Palette profiles no longer swap primaries on 7-colour ACeP panels.** A
  profile emits its colours in Spectra 6 slot order and was applied to the
  panel palette positionally, which on `inky_7colour` put the calibrated
  yellow where the panel paints green and the blue where it paints red. The
  override is now matched to the gamut's slots by colour. (#298)
- **The Gallery widget's Scale option now does something.** Every choice
  rendered as Fill: the client never read the option, and the shared
  full-bleed rule crops to cover. Fit letterboxes, Stretch distorts, Center
  shows native pixels, and Fit with blurred background paints a blurred copy
  of the picture behind the letterboxed one. (#296)
- **CircuitPython BMP frames have a fixed colour table per gamut.** The
  `circuitpython_bmp` renderer used to compact the table to the colours a
  page actually used, so a tri-colour page with no red on screen shipped as
  a 2-colour 1-bpp file and the next frame with red in it no longer matched
  a bitmap the client had sized from the earlier header. The table is now the
  gamut's whole palette in a fixed order on every frame, with `biClrUsed`
  set to its length, so bit depth and table are constant for a given gamut
  and `adafruit_imageload` sizes a 3-colour frame's bitmap at 3 values
  rather than 16. (#277)

## [0.392.0], 2026-09-06

### Added

- Startup warns while secrets are encrypted with the key derived from the
  session secret, and the warning carries a ready-to-paste
  `TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY=` line. The Docker install page gains a section on
  pinning the key before storing credentials. The HA App gets the note at
  info, since it has no environment block to put the key in.
- The session cookie is pinned to `SameSite=Lax` and `HttpOnly` rather
  than inherited from the browser's defaults.
- **Calendar, Month** gains a *Show "Week starts" label* option, off by
  default; the weekday headers already say which day leads.
- Companion publishers can choose snapshot retention up to 365 days or explicitly
  retain the latest snapshot until replacement or deletion. The optional
  `personal_data_retention` capability enables Never; freshness stays independent
  of expiry, and existing clients retain their chosen finite deadlines.
- Home Assistant MQTT discovery now exposes lineups and device
  operations. The hub device gains an *Automation* switch (pause every
  scheduled push), a *Quiet hours* switch, a switch per lineup with
  *Push now* / *Next* / *Previous* buttons, and a *Notify all displays*
  entity. Each display gains a *Lineup* select, a *Hold* number, a
  *Quiet hours override* switch, *In quiet hours* / *Online* / *Low
  battery* binary sensors, a *Next change* sensor, a *Refresh now*
  button, an *Input* event entity for physical buttons and touch
  gestures, a per-display notify entity, a *Wake interval* number where
  the kind carries one, a firmware *update* entity once the device
  advertises OTA, and lazy *Firmware* / *Temperature* / *Humidity* /
  *Uptime* / *Next wake* sensors.
- **Settings → App → Automation**: a *Pause automation* toggle that
  holds rotations, schedules, timed page refreshes, deck pre-renders and
  home returns until resumed. Manual sends and button presses still go
  through. Backs the HA *Automation* switch.
- The button service notifies listeners after every handled button
  press or touch gesture, and the deck store notifies listeners on every
  change, so integrations can mirror state without polling.

### Changed

- The panel-text language pickers (app default, per-device override, dev
  preview) now list every locale the installed widgets ship strings for,
  plus English, instead of a fixed English / French pair. A widget adding
  `strings/<tag>.json` is selectable as soon as it loads (#279).
- The TRMNL X hardware profile and the tested matrix record the panel as
  confirmed on real hardware with the stock firmware (1872x1404 mono PNG).
- The reTerminal Sticky hardware notes describe the partial refresh that
  firmware 1.30.0 brings (tap echo, device-drawn controls, live value slots
  and frame patches on this panel) and what still falls back to a full paint.

### Fixed

- A touch that rotated a lineup's page held the display until the
  rotation's next daily anchor, and that anchor was placed in UTC rather
  than the configured timezone, so an evening tap could pin a panel for
  most of the next day. Touch holds now last one dwell window of the step
  they landed on; button holds keep the anchor rule, placed in the app
  timezone. The timer also logs a skipped display as `manual hold` and the
  Lineups card shows **held** instead of the last successful send, so a
  held panel no longer looks frozen.
- **GTFS / GTFS-RT** reads feeds whose CSV header row is padded with
  spaces (`location_type, parent_station, stop_id, …`, as Transperth's
  is). The padding used to survive into the column names, so every stop
  lookup missed and the build failed with "isn't in this feed".
- LAB and chroma-aware colour matching now see the diffused error, so a
  flat patch dithers under them the way it always did under `rgb` instead
  of collapsing to a single ink.
- The Lineups 24h rail thins a dense schedule across the whole day instead
  of drawing only its first 48 fires.
- The rail's now-marker ticks in the configured app timezone rather than
  the browser's, so it no longer jumps by the zone offset a minute after
  the page loads.
- **Smart sync no longer starves a lineup on a short wake grid.** The
  render-before-wake gate only opened on a tick that landed inside the
  lead window, and the default 10 s lead is narrower than the 30 s tick.
  A trusted panel waking every 5 minutes kept the same tick phase on
  every wake, so a rotation could sit on one page for an hour while its
  card said it was playing. The gate now opens on the last tick before
  the window, and a rotation held by smart sync shows a *held* pill with
  the reason instead of staying silent.

- **Lineups remain visible after their displays are deleted.** Lineups whose
  targets are all gone now appear in an **Unavailable displays** group on the
  Lineups page instead of disappearing, so they can still be edited, rebound
  or deleted. The editors keep the stale display (and a wiped dashboard)
  selected, so saving no longer silently unbinds the lineup or re-points it at
  the first dashboard in the list.

- **A touch action no longer repaints a different lineup page over the
  one on glass.** The post-action reconcile resolved "the page the
  device is showing" from the lineup's nav record before the live frame,
  and that record lagged behind touch navigation: a `page:` shortcut
  tapped on a dashboard's nav bar pushed the target page without
  recording it as the device's lineup position. Tapping a control on the
  page then re-rendered the stale position and patched it onto the panel,
  so the panel showed one page while its touch regions still belonged to
  another. The reconcile now starts from the page behind the device's
  live frame, and a `page:` shortcut onto a lineup page records the
  position.
- **A lineup no longer re-promotes a pre-rendered frame that has gone
  stale.** When the background warms for a page keep failing, its cached
  frame kept being swapped onto the panel at every advance, so the
  display flipped between dashboards that were all hours old. An
  advance now renders the page live when the cached frame is older than
  twice its warm cadence, and says so in the log.
- **Chromium launches with `--disable-dev-shm-usage`.** Docker gives a
  container a 64 MB `/dev/shm` unless `shm_size` is set, and Chromium
  under that limit can crash or hang mid-render, which showed as panels
  that stopped repainting with nothing in the log.
- **Silent failure paths now log.** A failed push (with its render or
  publish error, previously a History row only), a deck warm that
  produces no frame, a lineup advance skipped for min-hold, smart-sync
  or quiet hours, a scheduler tick that overran its interval, and a
  tick that has been stuck for five minutes each write a line, so a
  debug report of a frozen panel carries the reason.

## [0.386.3], 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- **Pages pushed through the MCP bridge now carry their touch-v3 controls.**
  The bridge's push composed the page itself and handed the bytes to the
  image push path, which recorded the frame as an anonymous image. The
  device's touch spec is resolved from the page behind its live frame, so
  a device-drawn button or switch on an agent-pushed dashboard came back
  as an empty spec and was never drawn; the post-action reconcile could not
  find the page either. The image push now records the page id when the
  caller knows it, and the bridge passes it.

## [0.386.2], 2026-09-04

### Changed

- The reTerminal Sticky hardware notes record touch as verified on hardware
  (firmware 1.29.1 or later), with wake-from-deep-sleep on a tap the one
  path still to exercise.

## [0.386.1], 2026-09-04

### Added

- **Touch settings on the Seeed reTerminal Sticky.** The Sticky's device
  settings now carry the same "Touch input" and "Touch linger" fields as the
  reTerminal E1003, so a firmware build with the Sticky's GT911 wired up can
  be switched on from the server. The digitiser's orientation is confirmed
  on hardware; the hardware entry notes touch wake as the remaining check.
- **Refreshes per day on the Lineups page** (#278). Every schedule,
  rotation and timer-advancing deck card now shows how many pushes its
  timer projects for today, next to the next-fire time, and each display's
  section header sums them so the refresh load on a panel is readable at a
  glance. Counts are projections from the same walk that draws the 24h
  rail: conditions and the minimum hold can skip some, and taps, Send now
  and data-change refreshes are extra.
- **Editable calendar feed colours.** The colour swatch on each saved feed in Settings → Widgets → Calendar feeds is now a colour picker; pick a new colour and it saves in place, no need to delete and re-add the feed. Useful when tuning feed colours for a specific panel's gamut. (#276)
- **Trusted networks for the auth gate.** Settings → System →
  Authentication gains a "Trusted networks" list (also
  `TESSERAE_TRUSTED_NETWORKS`, comma-separated CIDRs). Networks listed
  there count as local alongside the fixed private ranges, so a LAN on a
  globally routable IPv6 prefix delegated by the ISP can fetch `/renders/`
  and, with the password disabled, reach the admin UI, instead of being
  treated as the open internet. `/0` is refused.
- **Waveshare 10.85" e-Paper HAT+ (G) hardware kind.** New `waveshare_1085g`
  kind for the 1360x480 four-colour (black/white/yellow/red) panel on an
  ESP32-S3 Zero: `bwry_4` gamut, a 163200-byte 2-bpp frame from the
  `esp32_bin` renderer, paired with the `waveshare-1085g` target in
  tesserae-device-firmware. Confirmed on real hardware and added to the
  test matrix.
- **The MCP bridge's widget catalog carries a one-sentence description per
  widget** (#257). `list_widgets` used to ship every widget's full description
  whether or not the agent placed it, the largest single item in a build's
  context budget. The catalog now carries the first sentence (capped at 160
  characters) and the per-widget options call returns the full text, which
  matches the list-then-read-options loop the tool docs already prescribe.
  Measured on the bundled set, the description block shrinks by about 69%.
  Bridge 0.15.0 also fixes the summarised view dropping descriptions
  entirely (it read the wrong key).
- **iCloud calendars work as private CalDAV feeds** (#272). iCloud has no
  GET-able `.ics` export: a plain GET is answered with a challenge-less 403,
  and events are only readable through CalDAV REPORT requests. Calendar feeds
  now fall back to a REPORT calendar-query (events across the expansion
  window, todos unbounded) and stitch the collection back into the same
  cached blob shape the widgets already read, and basic credentials ride on
  the first request since there is no 401 challenge to react to. Point
  Discover at `https://caldav.icloud.com/` with an Apple ID plus
  app-specific password and add calendars in one click.

### Fixed

- **Resend and Send-page pushes honour a client-declared rotation** (#275).
  A device that registers with `rotation` gets its dashboard composed for
  the turned canvas and rotated back onto its framebuffer on the way out.
  Pushing a page did this; resending it from History, or pushing a gallery
  / file / URL image from Send, did not: that path rebuilt the panel by
  hand and dropped the "declared by the device" flag the CircuitPython
  renderers key the turn on, so the client received a landscape frame for
  its portrait buffer. The Send-page path now carries the resolved panel
  through unchanged (which also restores `col_offset` on it).
- **iCloud calendar discovery no longer fails with HTTP 400** (#272).
  iCloud refuses a Depth 1 PROPFIND on its service root instead of listing
  it. When the listing is refused, Discover now walks root → principal →
  calendar-home-set with Depth 0 requests (the same path other CalDAV
  clients take) and enumerates the calendars on the per-account host it
  lands on. A wrong password still reports as an authentication failure.
- **Calendar feed failures now say why** (#272). The event fetch path never
  recorded feed health (only the todo path did), and the Refresh button
  flashed a generic "couldn't reach the feed URL" for every failure. Both now
  carry the real reason, e.g. `HTTP 403`, including which of the GET / REPORT
  paths failed how.
- **IPv6 binds work end to end.** Base URLs (Home Assistant discovery,
  frame URLs, broker URLs) bracket IPv6 hosts, the renderer's loopback
  rewrite targets `[::1]` when the server binds an IPv6 host (carried via
  `TESSERAE_BIND_HOST`, which now also feeds the `--host` default), and the
  auth gate unwraps IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses so dual-stack binds keep the
  loopback and private-range checks working.
- **Previews behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy no longer hang.** An
  `https` public URL leaked its scheme into the internal compose URL, so
  renders attempted a TLS handshake against the plain-HTTP in-process
  server and timed out. Loopback compose URLs are now always plain `http`.
- **Calendar (day) opens its window at local midnight** (#252). The widget
  draws one day, so the fetch window now starts at midnight instead of at
  the render time; "hours ahead" keeps its meaning as a forward bound from
  now, and the option label says so.
- **Calendar feeds keep separate events that reuse a UID.** The recurrence
  expander folds every VEVENT with the same UID into one event, so feeds
  that reuse a UID across copied appointments lost all but one. Plain
  duplicate VEVENTs (no RRULE or RECURRENCE-ID) are keyed by their start
  before expansion; recurring series and their overrides keep the shared
  UID.
- **Calendar (month) spreads multi-day timed events across every day they
  cover** (#267). A trip starting Friday afternoon and ending Monday morning
  showed in Friday's cell only, while the week view already spanned it.
  Each continued day renders as a dimmed pass-through row in the text
  layout (with the full title in the tooltip); the default bars mode is
  unchanged.
- **Lineup editor states the real loop length.** The advance interval is
  labelled as the default dwell with the computed full-loop total in the
  hint, the navigation badge uses the loop total when per-page dwells
  differ, and the background-refresh fallbacks match the model default of
  15 minutes, with help text noting the lineup cadence supersedes a member
  dashboard's own Updates setting (discussion #266).
- **History distinguishes background warms from frames a panel showed**
  (discussion #266). Deck and album warms log as "warmed" behind a History
  toggle, a cache-hit rotation advance writes the push row for the frame
  the panel actually showed, deck sources get friendly chips, and
  same-cadence warms de-phase after the first pass instead of staying in
  lockstep.
- **The per-device button map saves again.** The textarea on the device
  card was not associated with the card's combined form, so edits never
  showed the save bar and the value was dropped on submit.

- **Small dashboard changes no longer strand deep-sleep panels on an old
  frame** (#271). A small same-page change on a patch-capable REST device is
  delivered as partial-refresh patches with the frame digest held stable, but
  a deep-sleep device has no framebuffer in RAM on a timer wake and could
  never apply them, so the change silently never landed while the History tab
  showed the new render. The server now keeps the full render a patch divert
  replaced and, when the patch blob was never fetched by the device's next
  `/frame` poll, promotes it into the live slot so that poll serves a normal
  full frame. Devices that do apply patches (touch linger, SSE) keep the
  battery-friendly partial path unchanged; no firmware update is needed.
  `/preview/<device>.png` (and `/mirror/<device>`) now also serve the newest
  accepted composition instead of the held anchor, and a diverted render now
  writes through to the warmed deck cache the same way a normal stamp does.

### Added

- **Per-device "Update delivery" setting** (#271). Settings → Devices →
  General on REST instances: "Auto (partial refresh when possible)" is the
  default behaviour above; "Always full refresh" disables patch delivery for
  the device entirely, so every visible change mints a new frame and a full
  repaint. Useful where partial refresh ghosts or looks incomplete.

- **The web port is settable from Docker compose via `TESSERAE_BIND_PORT`.**
  The env var (already used to point loopback renders at the real bind port)
  now also drives the `--port` default, and the image CMD no longer passes an
  explicit `--port` that would override it. Under host networking, moving
  Tesserae off a contested 8765 is now one `environment:` line instead of a
  `command:` override. An explicit `--port` flag still wins, and the env var
  is rewritten to the resolved port so loopback renders always target the
  actual bind.

- **Consolidated configuration reference in the docs.** New
  `install/configuration.md` page listing every CLI flag and `TESSERAE_*`
  environment variable (serving, storage, secrets, logging, experiment
  overrides) plus the role of `settings.json`, so deployment knobs are no
  longer scattered across install pages and source comments. The Docker page
  gains "Change the web port" and broker-on-the-Docker-host sections.

- **Seeed XIAO ePaper EE03 (10.3" mono) hardware kind.** The EE03 DIY kit puts
  the reTerminal E1003's exact 10.3" panel + controller combo (ED103TC2 behind
  an IT8951, 1872x1404, 16-level greyscale) on the XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus driver
  board, so the new `seeed_ee03` kind reuses the `esp32_gray_bin` renderer and
  packs a byte-identical 1314144-byte frame. Registered with `auto_select`
  off: the two kinds are indistinguishable on the wire and a kind names an
  OTA lineage, so relay pairing keeps resolving to the E1003 and EE03 units
  declare their kind themselves at registration. Firmware target lands in
  tesserae-device-firmware as `seeed-ee03` (awaiting hardware verification).

### Fixed

- **Calendar widgets no longer fail with "invalid language tag: C".** With the app
  locale left on "system", a host `LANG`/`LC_ALL` of `C.UTF-8` (the usual default in
  Docker and Ubuntu environments) leaked through locale detection as the literal tag
  `C`, which the calendar Day / Week / Month widgets' date formatting rejects. `C` and
  `POSIX` values are now treated as "no locale configured" regardless of codeset
  suffix, falling back to the next source in the chain.

### Added

- **Calendar widgets can read Home Assistant calendars.** A calendar feed can now point
  at any `calendar.*` entity instead of an iCal URL: on the Calendar Feeds page, "Add
  from Home Assistant" lists the calendars HA knows about (Local Calendar, Google, waste
  collection, anything an integration exposes) and adds each as a feed in one click,
  using the connection already configured in the Home Assistant Core plugin. Events flow
  through the same `load_events()` path, so every calendar widget (Day / Week / Month
  and the marketplace Schedule widget) picks them up unchanged, with per-feed name and
  colour, feed-health reporting, and a 15-minute cache per requested window. Recurrence
  expansion happens inside Home Assistant, so these feeds skip the ICS expansion cache.

- **The Home Assistant Sensor and Entities widgets can hide the title row and entity
  names.** Two new toggles per cell: "Show title row" removes the whole header (so a
  single entity renders as just its value), and "Show entity names" drops the per-row
  label in list mode, leaving icon + value. Both default to on, so existing cells are
  unchanged.

- **Synchronized wake: a fleet of devices can paint together on a wall-clock grid.**
  New per-device setting on the device card's Schedule tab (REST devices, off by
  default). "On the clock" keeps the sleep interval as the period but lands each wake on
  `anchor + k × interval` local time (a 15-minute panel anchored at 00:05 wakes at :05 /
  :20 / :35 / :50); "at set times" wakes only at a listed set of `HH:MM` times. Devices
  set to the same grid wake and repaint together with no cross-device coordination; an
  "apply to all devices" switch copies the setting to every REST device in one save. The
  server recomputes the grid delta on every check-in (so error never accumulates), skips
  grid points inside quiet hours, learns each device's wake-to-paint latency from its
  telemetry and shifts the wake earlier by that lead so the paint itself lands on the
  grid. The `/status` response additionally carries the same instant as an absolute
  `wake_at` epoch for firmware that can sleep to a wall-clock target; older firmware
  ignores it and still lands close via `next_poll_s`.
- **The dev widget previews can be rendered in a chosen language.** `/_test/widgets` and
  `/_test/preview` now carry an English / French locale picker; it adds `?locale=<tag>` to the
  render so a contributor can check a widget's translated strings and its `Intl` date / number
  formatting without touching any install-wide or per-device setting.
- **The Calendar (week) widget is translated to French.** Header, event counts, and the
  weekday / month labels follow the render locale; non-English names come from `Intl`
  rather than a hand-rolled table.
- **The Calendar (month) widget is translated to French.** Month title, weekday header,
  and the week-start note follow the render locale, on the same `Intl` + `strings/` path
  as the week widget. The weekday header row now upper-cases by default like the other
  calendar labels (sentence-case styles still get sentence case via `--label-transform`).

### Fixed

- **Six widgets that fetch with raw urllib now request and decode plain responses**
  (#215). Reddit News, Hacker News, Wikipedia On This Day, NASA APOD, Sunrise & Sunset,
  and the Home Assistant core plugin sent no `Accept-Encoding` header, which lets a
  CDN-fronted upstream answer with gzip that urllib does not decompress; the widget then
  reports a parser error instead of the real cause. Each site now asks for `identity`
  and decodes any `Content-Encoding` the server sends anyway, the same guard the RSS and
  calendar widgets already carry.
- **The Webpage widget's settle delay is now honoured in full, fixing intermittent blank
  captures.** The wait for the embedded page previously ran under a fixed 12-second cap
  covering page load *and* settle together, so a slow-loading site silently ate into the
  configured settle window, and a site that took longer than the cap to load was captured
  blank. The cap is now the full settle delay plus a 10-second load grace, and the
  renderer's screenshot budget was raised to outlast the worst case.
- **Setup and sign-in errors now show inline in the card.** A too-short or mismatched
  password on `/setup`, and a wrong password on `/login`, previously surfaced only as a
  corner toast that auto-dismisses after five seconds; when the field was filled by a
  password manager (which bypasses the browser's `minlength` check) the page could appear
  to reload with no feedback at all (#265). The error now renders as a persistent strip
  inside the form card.

## [0.367.3], 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **Corrected the Xteink X4 hardware notes: no per-firmware orientation is needed.**
  v0.367.2 claimed the native firmware required plain `landscape`; hardware testing
  showed the same registration paints upright on both CrossInk and the native firmware,
  so orientation is the ordinary mounting choice and the notes now say so.

## [0.367.2], 2026-08-27

### Changed

- **The Xteink X4 hardware entry now covers the native device firmware as well as
  CrossInk.** The `xteink_x4` kind's notes spell out that the two firmware paths need
  different orientation values (CrossInk keeps the `portrait_flipped` default; the native
  `xteink-x4` firmware wants the device set to plain `landscape`), and that the native
  build drives the SSD1677 panel revision only, while CrossInk auto-detects the later
  UC8179/UC8279 revisions.

## [0.367.1], 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **A TRMNL device whose refresh rate was never saved polled at 900 seconds while the
  settings form showed 60.** The /api/display fallback was a hardcoded 900 instead of the
  schema default the form displays. Combined with the silent preset-save bug fixed in
  v0.364.5, this read as the refresh rate "reverting to 900" whenever a preset pick failed
  to save. The fallback now comes from the device kind's own schema default.

## [0.367.0], 2026-08-26

### Changed

- **Panels can now be set to refresh as often as every 5 seconds.** The minimum
  sleep/refresh interval across every device kind drops to 5 seconds (it was 30 seconds,
  or 5 minutes for the Crosspoint reader), and the server's own poll floor drops to
  match, so a device asked to poll hot actually gets told to. The old floor existed to
  stop a typo from flattening a battery; on battery-powered panels long intervals are
  still the right choice, since every refresh is a full wake plus Wi-Fi cycle.

## [0.366.1], 2026-08-26

### Changed

- **The affiliate-link disclosure now mentions the checkout discount.** The earlier wording
  said the tagged links leave the price unchanged, based on the product page, which shows the
  undiscounted price. A real checkout through a tagged link does apply a discount, so the
  disclosure in the README and the compatibility page now says so.

## [0.366.0], 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Widgets can now be translated into other languages, starting with Calendar Day in French
  (#261).** Widget authors can add a translation for their widget's on-screen text; Tesserae
  shows the right language automatically. A widget with no translation yet keeps working
  exactly as before, in English.
- **You can now choose what language your dashboards display in.** Set one default for the
  whole install under Settings → Server, or give an individual panel its own language under
  Settings → Devices.

## [0.365.0], 2026-08-26

### Added

- **Seeed XIAO ePaper EE05 with the 2.13" quadruple-colour BWRY panel (firmware #29).** New
  hardware kind `seeed_ee05_213_bwry`: the XIAO ESP32-S3 Plus display board driving the
  122x250 black/white/yellow/red panel (JD79676 controller) over the 24-pin FPC, packed by the
  existing esp32_bin 2-bpp BWRY path. Awaiting confirmation on real hardware; the matching
  firmware target ships separately in tesserae-device-firmware.

- **Panels can declare hidden columns (`panel.col_offset`).** Small panels often have a
  controller stride wider than the glass; the EE05's 2.13" panel drives 128 columns with only
  122 visible. A manifest that declares `col_offset` alongside `native_w`/`native_h` now gets
  its frame pasted into the native stride at that offset with white padding, instead of being
  scaled to the stride and distorted. Manifests without the field keep the previous behaviour
  unchanged.

## [0.364.6], 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **The edge add-on could offer an update whose image did not exist yet.** The add-on repo was
  bumped by the same push event that starts the container build, and the two are not the same
  length: the bump takes about fifteen seconds, the multi-arch build about five minutes. For
  those five minutes after every commit to main, Home Assistant was told a new edge version was
  available and could not pull it, failing with "image does not exist". Worse, the add-on was
  then left pointing at an image it had never pulled, so every later start raised a repair
  notice rather than recovering.

  The edge sync now runs when the image build finishes rather than when the commit lands, and
  refuses to publish a version it cannot pull from the registry. Anyone who hit this can update
  again; the image has been there since shortly after the failure.

## [0.364.5], 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **Changing a device's sleep interval left the Save button hidden (#260).** The interval is a
  preset dropdown backed by a hidden number field, and picking a preset copies the value across
  in script. Script assignment fires no input event, and the dropdown itself isn't submitted so
  it had no form association of its own once the device card's fields moved to attribute-based
  association in v0.364.4. Between the two, the value changed with nothing on the page hearing
  about it: the save bar stayed hidden and the edit looked ignored until some other field was
  touched, which then saved the interval along with it.

  Picking a preset now announces the change on the field that carries it, and the dropdown is
  associated with the same form regardless. This applies to every preset field, not just the
  sleep interval.

## [0.364.4], 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **The colour-calibration buttons on a device card did nothing.** Send and the answer buttons
  sat inside the card's combined-save form, and a browser drops a nested form start tag while
  another form is open, so those buttons submitted the save instead and no calibration card was
  ever pushed to the panel. The combined form is now an empty element above the tabs, with its
  inputs and the calibration buttons attached to it by name, so no form on the page nests inside
  another.

## [0.364.2], 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **A calendar test failed depending on what time of day CI ran.** `calendar_day` shows only
  events on the current date, and its fixtures placed them at "now plus one to five hours", so
  a run late in the evening pushed most of them past midnight and the day view correctly
  dropped them. Anchored to midday in the app's own timezone instead, which is the same date
  whatever the hour.

## [0.364.1], 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **A saved secret that can no longer be decrypted now says so, instead of looking like it was
  never entered.** Tesserae encrypts secrets at rest. If the encryption key changes, which is
  what a recreated container or a restored data folder does when `TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY` isn't
  pinned, the stored value can't be read and every runtime read gets an empty string. That is
  deliberate, so one stale value can't take a whole settings section down with it, but the
  admin UI still showed the field masked as though a working secret were saved, and widgets
  reported "Home Assistant is not configured" to people who had configured it.

  The settings form now leaves such a field empty, marks it "Re-enter to repair", and explains
  what happened. Home Assistant widgets say the token can no longer be decrypted and where to
  fix it, rather than claiming nothing was set up. A missing token is also now distinguished
  from a completely unconfigured install.

  Nothing else is affected by the key change: URLs, dashboards and every non-secret setting are
  stored in the clear and survive. Re-entering the secret repairs it.

## [0.364.0], 2026-08-25

### Added

- **You can talk back to the agent from the editor.** The rail narrated what the agent was
  doing and gave you no way to answer it, so noticing a build going the wrong way meant
  switching to wherever the agent was running and typing there.

  The rail's header now carries a reply button. Type a note, press Enter, and it reaches the
  agent on its very next call, which during a build is a second or two. There is no way to do
  better than that and it is worth knowing why: MCP is driven entirely by the client, so a
  server can never push anything into a model's context. The only channel is the return value
  of a call the agent was going to make anyway, which is exactly what this rides on.

  Off unless you open it, and the choice sticks per browser. The button only appears when the
  `mcp` experiment is on, so an install with no agent shows no dead control. Notes are queued
  in memory, capped at eight, and delivered once each: a note repeated back to a model reads
  as you saying it twice. Posting one needs an admin session, since the MCP token authorises
  the agent and this is the human going the other way.

## [0.363.0], 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **Editing a page full of Home Assistant widgets no longer crawls.** Every preview refresh
  used to download Home Assistant's complete entity state list once per cell, and the trend
  arrows and sparklines added a separate 24-hour history query per entity, one after another.
  Opening the editor was worse still: each HA widget's entity dropdown pulled its own full
  state dump, in sequence, before the page appeared. On a modest host (a NAS, a Pi) with a
  busy HA install, Edit mode was close to unusable.

  The state list is now fetched once and shared through a short-lived cache, so six cells and
  thirteen dropdowns cost one request instead of nineteen, and an unreachable HA fails fast
  once instead of stacking timeouts. History queries run in parallel, keep within the render
  budget, and are cached for a couple of minutes. Typing in the sensor widget's per-entity
  overrides no longer re-renders the preview on every keystroke; it refreshes when you leave
  the field, and drag-to-reorder now refreshes immediately.

## [0.362.0], 2026-08-24

### Added

- **The reTerminal E series can beep when you touch it (#258).** E-ink repaints in seconds, so
  a tap or a button press gives the person standing at the panel nothing to go on until the
  whole pipeline has finished: dispatch, render, download, flash. Every display in the series
  has a buzzer on the board that Tesserae has never used.

  **Settings → Devices** → the display → **General** now carries **Beep on interaction**, with a
  tone (click, beep, chirp, low) and a volume next to it. The panel sounds it itself, the instant
  the touch controller or a button reports the input, before the server is contacted: a beep the
  server triggered would arrive with the repaint, which is the wait it exists to cover. The
  button-only models (E1001, E1002, E1004) get it on presses; the E1003 gets it on taps too.

  The tones are data, not firmware: Tesserae sends the notes themselves, as `freq:ms` pairs,
  so retuning one is a settings change rather than a firmware release, and **Custom** lets you
  write your own (up to eight notes, 200-8000 Hz, a second in total, since it plays before the
  tap is dispatched). The display holds no tone table and clamps whatever it is sent.

  Off by default, because a display that starts beeping after an update nobody asked for is
  worse than a silent one. Needs firmware v1.22.0 or later; displays on older firmware ignore
  the setting.

## [0.361.0], 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **Following the agent could land you on a dashboard that isn't there.** The toast and the
  editor's rail take the dashboard to open from the calls the agent makes, and a call names a
  dashboard whether or not one exists: an agent that writes to a page before creating it gets a
  404 and the toast offered to follow it there anyway. The same went for a page the agent had
  just deleted, and for pages the canvas editor cannot open at all. Both surfaces are now handed
  a dashboard id only when it names a canvas dashboard that exists, so the step still narrates
  but there is nothing to follow.

### Changed

- **The rail no longer announces the end of a build that is still going.** It called a run
  finished after twelve seconds without a call, which is a pause, not an ending: the model thinks
  between tool calls, and long code elements stream in bursts. A gap now reads as thinking, with
  the ring still turning and the count still climbing, and only a silence long enough for the
  server to close the run reads as finished. The toast follows the same two stages instead of
  vanishing mid-build and popping back.
- **The follow toast is a tape of the last few steps** rather than a single line that replaces
  itself. Older steps dim, repeats fold (streaming a code element is one call per chunk), and the
  header carries the dashboard name with the step count and elapsed time. A dot in the header
  pulses while calls are landing and stalls while the agent is thinking, so the state is legible
  without reading it.

## [0.360.0], 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **A touch panel that is already awake now picks up a new dashboard instead of sleeping
  through it (#242).** After a tap, a touch display stays awake for its touch linger window,
  and in that window it watches a data endpoint for small changes rather than polling for a
  whole new frame. That works when the change is small enough to arrive as patched rectangles.
  Anything bigger mints a new frame instead: a booking that repaints most of the screen, a page
  edit, a renderer setting change, or an external `POST /api/v1/push` from your own software.
  None of those had any way to reach a display that was awake and watching, so the panel sat
  there, went back to sleep, and only caught up on its next scheduled wake, up to a full sleep
  interval later.

  The data endpoint now answers `"stale": true` with the current frame digest when the display
  is showing something the server has moved past, which sends it to fetch the new frame there
  and then. This is what makes `webhook_refresh` land promptly on a screen-sized change, and it
  also means a webhook receiver of your own that pushes back to Tesserae updates the panel
  within a second or two of the push rather than at the next wake.

  Displays playing a deck page or a collection frame from their own cache are excluded: those
  navigated there locally, and the live frame changing underneath is not a reason to pull them
  back. Firmware v1.21.0 acts on the signal; older firmware ignores it and behaves as before.

## [0.359.0], 2026-08-24

### Added

- **You can watch the agent build.** An MCP build used to be a silent canvas that
  occasionally changed under you. Every authorised call to the MCP surface is now recorded on an
  in-process activity bus (endpoint, what it touched, how long it took, whether it worked) and
  fed to three new pieces of UI.

  In the canvas editor, a rail in the right sidebar leads with the step in flight, phrased as a
  sentence ("Streaming code in, css, +260 B of 833 B") with a ring that sweeps while it runs.
  Finished steps compress into ticks below it, repeats folding into one counted line, so
  streaming a code element reads as `Stream code x8` rather than eight rows. The agent's reads
  fold the same way. A pill in the toolbar keeps the build visible with the sidebar collapsed.

  Elements now land one at a time instead of the whole canvas repainting: the editor diffs the
  incoming document, so a new element reveals top-down like a panel refresh, an edited one
  pulses, and a code element being streamed holds a running underline until the chunks stop.
  Untouched widgets keep their live mount and no longer flicker, and the selection survives an
  agent edit.

  Everywhere else in the admin, a toast names the dashboard being built, narrates each step, and
  offers to open the editor, following after a short countdown by default. Following is a
  checkbox on the toast and it sticks. It never navigates over unsaved edits, a form you are
  typing in, or an open modal, and history never triggers it: a tab opened after a build
  finished stays put.

  The rail also reports what a build costs the agent's context. Real token usage isn't available
  to a self-hosted server (MCP carries no usage field, and the model's accounting lives in the
  agent's client), so this measures the exact bytes each call sends and returns and estimates
  tokens from them. Individually small steps stay quiet; a fold shows the sum, which is where it
  earns its place: reading the widget catalog costs around 5,700 tokens, more than every write in
  a typical build put together. The figure is always marked approximate, and runs low, since JSON
  tokenizes worse than prose.

  The editor's rail reads a Server-Sent Events stream for immediacy; the admin shell polls a
  snapshot instead, and only while its tab is visible, because every open tab would otherwise
  hold a worker thread it never uses. Both surfaces are gated on the `mcp` experiment, so with
  no agent connected nothing is wired up at all.

## [0.358.0], 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Seeed product links are affiliate links now, and say so.** The seven SKUs covered by the
  programme carry a Tesserae affiliate tag in their catalog `url`, which is the single field the
  README table and the generated compatibility matrix both read. A disclosure sits next to the
  links on every surface that renders one, rather than in a footer.

  The wording claims a commission and explicitly **not** a discount, because there isn't one: the
  affiliate parameter sets a tracking cookie and leaves the price identical (checked against the
  store page with and without it). Seeed's programme does offer a follower discount, but it
  arrives as a separate custom code. Nothing should promise readers money off until such a code
  exists.

  Five Seeed SKUs keep plain product links: the EE04 pair, the XIAO 7.5" Panel and its BWR
  sibling, and the C3 panel. The affiliate id looks account-level rather than per-product, so
  extending it is a one-line change per manifest if wanted.

  The tag never reaches the app: no template renders a hardware `url`, so a self-hosted Tesserae
  contains no affiliate link.

## [0.357.1], 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **The reTerminal Sticky was missing from the surfaces that list supported hardware.** It has
  shipped since 0.344.0 with a confirmed-on-hardware manifest, a firmware build and a flasher
  entry, but it was absent from the README's Seeed table, absent from the confirmed-panel list on
  the docs home page (which still said thirteen), and absent from `esp32_gray2_bin`'s tested note
  despite being one of the panels that renderer is confirmed on. Its catalog entry also carried no
  `url`, so it was the one Seeed SKU in the compatibility matrix rendered as plain text rather than
  a product link.

- **The M5Stack PaperS3 is listed in the README**, pointing at M5's documentation rather than their
  store: M5 have marked it end of life and it is sold out, so the entry is for people who already
  own one rather than an invitation to buy.

## [0.357.0], 2026-08-24

### Added

- **M5Stack PaperS3.** A 4.7" 960x540 touch e-ink handheld, added as kind `m5stack_papers3` on
  the existing `esp32_gray_bin` path: same 4-bpp linear-greyscale wire format as the reTerminal
  E1003, 259200 bytes at this geometry, so the server side is a catalog entry and nothing else.
  The firmware needed a driver family of its own, since this is the first panel with no controller
  chip between the MCU and the glass.

  Composition is 540x960 portrait against a 960x540 firmware stride: the panel's source driver
  scans landscape and the device is a portrait handheld, so `esp32_gray_bin` rotates and packs
  landscape rows. **Nothing here has been on real glass.** If a first frame lands upside down,
  the display's `flip` is the correction and it needs no code change.

  `touch` is false and there is no partial-refresh path, so this SKU offers neither tap echo nor
  on-device touch controls yet. Both are follow-ups, sequenced behind a panel that paints
  correctly.

### Fixed

- **Relay pairing now separates same-gamut SKUs by the stride a panel actually reports.** When two
  catalog SKUs share a protocol and gamut, the tie-break compared the reported geometry against the
  manifest's *composition* dimensions only. A transposed SKU reports the row stride its firmware
  reads, not the orientation it composes at, so it matched nothing and the answer fell through to an
  alphabetical id sort. That was right for the pair that existed and right by accident. The
  comparison now also accepts `native_w`/`native_h`, still exact and still in the declared axis
  order (tolerating a swapped pair would have the Xteink X4 answer to the reTerminal E1001's report
  as well as its own).

## [0.356.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Tool descriptions are served, not baked in.** `/api/mcp/instructions` already served the
  handshake instructions and canvas doc-shape, so those reached an installed bridge without a
  release; each tool's own description did not, which is why a wrong `create_schedule` contract sat
  on PyPI for three weeks. The payload now carries `tool_docs`, a description per tool, and the
  bridge prefers it over its embedded docstring. What still needs a release is a *new* tool (the
  tool list is code) and any change to how the bridge handles a result. Additive key, no `schema`
  bump: bumping would make older bridges treat the whole payload as unreadable.

- **An out-of-date bridge says so in the agent session.** 0.354.0 surfaced this in Settings, which
  only helps someone who looks. The bridge now compares its own version against the `bridge.latest`
  the server reports and, when behind, appends a note to the handshake instructions telling the
  agent to ask the operator to run `pipx upgrade tesserae-mcp`. Silent when level, ahead (running
  from a clone), or unparseable.

- **tesserae-mcp 0.14.0** carries both, plus a `set_canvas` docstring so every registered tool has
  a description of its own to fall back on.

## [0.355.1], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **Changelog accuracy.** The 0.355.0 entry listed the icon-reference work as unreleased; the
  `mcp-v0.12.0` tag pointed at that commit, so it shipped inside 0.12.0.

## [0.355.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **tesserae-mcp 0.13.0.** The bridge has carried unreleased changes since 0.12.0 went to PyPI on
  31 July, and two of them are functional rather than cosmetic: `probe_widget_data` now truncates
  long lists (a 24h Home Assistant history overflowed the tool-result cap, making the whole result
  unusable) and `list_widgets` summarises the ~95k-character catalog. The rest are tool
  descriptions, which the server cannot push to an installed bridge: `create_schedule`'s `name` and
  `fires_at` contract, and `render_report`'s `injected_libs` section and CSS-diagnostic wording.
  Upgrade with `pipx upgrade tesserae-mcp`; an install that doesn't will now be told, by the card
  added in 0.354.0.

## [0.354.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Settings flags an out-of-date MCP bridge.** `tesserae-mcp` is installed separately from
  Tesserae, so an install could sit on an old bridge indefinitely with nothing to say so. The
  handshake instructions and canvas doc-shape are served live from `/api/mcp/instructions`, so
  those keep up on their own; what only a release moves is the tool list, each tool's own
  description, and the bridge's client-side result trimming. Every bridge call already names its
  version in `User-Agent`, so Settings → System → MCP now records it and reveals a "Connected
  bridge" card with the version, when it was last seen, and the `pipx upgrade` line when it is
  behind the release this repo ships. The card appears only once a client has actually connected,
  and opens on its own only when there is something to act on. A client that isn't the bridge is
  shown as a connection without a version to compare, and a bridge *ahead* of this server (a clone)
  is not nagged. `/api/mcp/instructions` also names the shipped bridge, as an additive key needing
  no schema bump.

### Fixed

- **The bridge install command pointed at an archived repo.** Settings, the package README, and the
  missing-SDK error all said `pip install git+https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-mcp`, which is
  archived at 0.5.0; development moved into this monorepo. All three now say
  `pipx install tesserae-mcp`, matching the install guide.

## [0.353.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The element discriminator is documented.** The canvas doc shape showed `"els": [ <element>, … ]`
  and never expanded `<element>` or named the field the type goes in, so the only way to learn it
  was to `get_canvas` an existing page and read a real element back. `DOC_SHAPE` now spells out that
  the type goes in `kind` and not `type`, and lists the kinds. `add_element` says the same, since it
  is where the 422 is met.

- **`list_widgets` no longer overflows the tool-result cap.** The full catalog runs to ~95k
  characters, so it spooled to a file the caller then had to grep, for a question ("which widget do
  I want") that is cheap to answer. Each widget is now summarised to its identity, description and
  fragments; `get_widget_options(key)` already answers the option schema, for one widget rather than
  every widget at once. The appearance / libraries / icons blocks pass through untouched, being
  small and exactly what a summary cannot stand in for. `section=` narrows to one block and
  `full=True` returns the unsummarised catalog.

## [0.352.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **`create_schedule`'s tool doc contradicted the model.** It described `fires_at` as `"HH:MM"` and
  never mentioned `name`, so a daily schedule written straight from the doc 422s twice over.
  `fires_at` is a full datetime (only the time-of-day is read, so the date is a placeholder and
  `"2000-01-01T06:00:00"` is the conventional way to write 6am), and `name` is required alongside
  `id` with `min_length=1`.

## [0.351.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`icons` on a code element: explicit Phosphor opt-in, alongside the scan rather than replacing
  it.** The sandbox infers which icon weights to inline by scanning the element's own html/css/js.
  That is a heuristic on author text, so it cuts both ways: it misses icons a script builds after
  render, and it over-reaches, because the injected stylesheet owns `.ph` / `.ph-*` and an element
  using `.ph` as its OWN class name has that span restyled to the icon font, silently losing its
  Latin text.

  Declaring the field takes the guess out and always wins:

  - `false` injects no icon CSS at all
  - `true` injects the regular weight
  - `["bold", "fill"]` injects exactly those weights

  Omitted (the default) keeps the scan, so every element built before this field behaves
  identically. Narrower than `autolibs: false`, which also refuses Chart.js, fonts and every other
  bundle; non-icon libraries keep inferring either way. `render_report`'s `injected_libs` marks an
  entry `inferred: false` when the field chose it, so a report says which path was taken.

## [0.350.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The CSS diagnostic reported a rewrite as a drop.** `render_report`'s analysis diffs the authored
  selectors against the ones the parser kept, but the parser rewrites what it keeps: legacy
  `a:before` comes back as `a::before`. `normSel` collapsed whitespace and quotes but not `::`, so
  any rule written with the single-colon form was reported as "dropped by the CSS parser" while it
  was applying perfectly well.

  decorate.js's in-sandbox `cssSelfCheck` already collapsed `::` in its own normaliser, so the two
  analysers disagreed with each other about the same stylesheet. A diagnostic that contradicts the
  render is worse than no diagnostic: it sends the author looking for a parser bug that isn't there.

## [0.349.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **`probe_widget_data` truncates long lists.** A large payload (a 24h Home Assistant history runs
  to hundreds of KB) overflowed the MCP result limit with no truncation or pagination, so the whole
  result was unusable and the only recourse was grepping a saved tool-result file. Lists are now
  capped at `max_items` (default 20), each trimmed list gaining a sibling `<key>__truncated` with
  its real length so the shape stays self-describing rather than silently looking short. Scalars,
  short lists and nesting are untouched.

  `fields` is never truncated, since the bindable dot-paths are the reason to call the tool at all.
  `full=True` returns the whole payload for the cases that genuinely need every row.

## [0.348.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **`ctx.options` was always `{}` for code elements.** decorate.js builds it from `el.options`, and
  the composer's `kind == "code"` branch never put options in the payload. A config input declared
  with `slot: "options"` therefore rendered in the form, saved into the document, and did nothing at
  render. Only a source's options travelled, and those go to the widget fetch rather than to the
  author's code.

- **A window-shadowing global blanked the whole element.** Author JS ran at the sandbox's global
  scope inside a bare `try{}`, which is not a function scope. `var top = ...` there cannot overwrite
  the read-only `window.top`: the assignment silently fails, `top` stays a cross-origin Window, and
  the next property read throws "Blocked a frame with origin null", so the element rendered as red
  error text. Same trap for `name`, `status`, `length`, `self`, `parent` and `closed`, none of which
  a dashboard author has reason to treat as reserved. The code now runs inside a function, where
  they are ordinary locals.

  The tradeoff is that a top-level `function foo(){}` is no longer reachable from an inline
  `onclick`. The frame is `pointer-events: none` and taps arrive through touch regions, so nothing
  in a panel could call one anyway.

- **`console.log` never reached `render_report(debug=1)`.** The console hook dropped every level
  that wasn't `error` or `warning`, so print-debugging a sandboxed code element was impossible.
  Non-error levels now come through on their own budget rather than sharing the single event cap,
  so a chatty element can never push a stack trace out of the report.

## [0.347.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The calibration preview showed Spectra 6 on grayscale panels.** v0.346.0 unhid the Calibration
  tab for grey gamuts without making the surfaces behind it grey-aware, so three of them still
  assumed colour. `test_patterns._palette_for` fell through to the six-colour E6 deck for any
  unrecognised gamut, so the preview painted primaries a grey panel cannot produce, and the
  profile's own ramp was then discarded by the length guard so none of the calibration being
  applied was visible. The preview override read `profile.palette`, which on a grey profile is an
  untouched default, i.e. literal `#ff0000` / `#00ff00`. The solid-fill picker offered six inks
  from the same fallback.

- **The palette editor offered ink pickers a grey profile has no slots for.** The grid is now one
  cell per level, keyed `level0..levelN`, and its save route writes the ramp instead of reading
  colour names it would never find. Live preview posts the same keys.

- **Editing a grey profile wiped its ramp.** Every settings route rebuilds the profile field by
  field to save it, and none of them carried `gray`, so touching an unrelated tone slider silently
  reset a calibrated panel back to the even ramp. All five rebuild sites now carry it.

### Added

- **`strong-mid-gray4`,** a much larger correction than `soft-mid-gray4` for a panel still washed
  out with that one. Also not a measurement.

## [0.346.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **Grayscale calibration.** The grey packers quantised against a perfectly even ramp (`i * 85` for
  4-level, `i * 17` for 16-level) and took no palette at all, while the colour packer has had
  `palette_override` and a full tone-knob set for versions. Real e-paper grey waveforms are not
  even in reflectance, so a panel whose middle levels print lighter than that renders washed out,
  and error diffusion compounds it by diffusing error against values the panel never produces.

  A profile now carries a `gray` ramp: `#rrggbb` anchors, darkest first, describing **what the
  panel actually prints**. That inverts the intuition, and is the thing to know before touching it:
  a panel rendering too light is corrected by declaring its mid-levels *lighter*, because that
  tells the quantizer those levels overshoot and it should reach for a darker one.

  Any two-or-more anchor count works and interpolates to whatever a gamut needs, so four patches
  judged by eye drive a 16-level panel. The override changes which level each pixel gets and never
  the wire format, since the packed bytes are level indices either way. A wrong-length override is
  ignored rather than padded, which would silently remap every level above the gap.

  Bundled: `nominal-gray4` / `nominal-gray16` (evenly spaced, the default, so nothing changes for
  an existing panel) and `soft-mid-gray4` / `soft-mid-gray16`, a starting point for a washed-out
  panel. The soft ramps are **not** measurements of any particular unit and say so.

- **Grey panels get a Calibration tab.** `_palette_family_for` mapped only the colour gamuts to a
  profile family and returned empty for everything else, so a `gray_4` / `gray_16` device had no
  picker at all and no way to reach a ramp.

### Fixed

- **A palette whose first entry is not pure black could paint black pixels white.** The 256-entry
  palette image Pillow matches against was padded with zeroes, and Pillow considers every slot, so
  the padding acted as pure black in the match. A black pixel took a padding slot instead of entry
  0, and the packers, which clip an out-of-range index to the top of the range, resolved that to
  white.

  Invisible while every palette's first entry happened to be `#000000`, since Pillow settles the
  tie on the lowest index. Not invisible for a measured colour profile, whose black is nearer
  `#1F2226`, and it surfaced immediately on the first calibrated grey ramp. Padding now repeats the
  last real entry, so a stray match lands on a colour the palette genuinely has.

## [0.345.0], 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **The Sticky painted every frame repeated sideways, in the wrong orientation.**
  `seeed_reterminal_sticky` declared `native_w`/`native_h` as the controller's 800x480 landscape
  scan. Those fields mean the row stride the *firmware* reads, and this firmware transposes on the
  device: it wants 120-byte portrait rows and rotates them itself. The renderer took the landscape
  declaration at face value, rotated the composition 90 degrees and packed 200-byte rows.

  Both layouts are exactly 96000 bytes, so every size check passed and the frame was simply read
  at the wrong stride. Now `480x800`, matching the composition, and the renderer's
  `orientation_mismatch` branch no longer fires.

  The test that covered this asserted the byte count only, which is the one property both layouts
  share. It now asserts the row layout: a source whose top 8 rows are black must pack to 8*120
  leading zero bytes, which fails under the landscape pack.

- **Sticky instances migrated under v0.344.0 are corrected in place.** An instance carries its own
  copy of the kind's panel block and that copy wins, so correcting the manifest alone would never
  have reached a device that had already migrated: it would have kept the landscape stride
  indefinitely. `migrate_retired_sticky_kinds` now also rewrites the stride on instances already on
  the successor kind, and only when it is the exact wrong pair, so an operator's deliberate value
  is left alone.

## [0.344.0], 2026-08-23

### Removed

- **`seeed_sticky` and `seeed_sticky_gray` retired.** One physical product carried three catalog
  entries. These two described it running CrossInk and were written from the V01 schematic and
  Seeed's vendor peripheral demo rather than a validated unit: never confirmed on hardware, and
  declaring a self-flagged provisional `portrait_flipped` the board does not use.
  `seeed_reterminal_sticky` supersedes both, and the Sticky now appears once.

  The split was never cosmetic, which is why the merge is a removal rather than a fold. A kind is
  an OTA lineage: release descriptors are signed with a `device_kind`, rejected on
  `kind_mismatch`, and `auto_update_ids` sweeps every device of a kind. Two firmwares sharing one
  kind would offer tesserae-device-firmware images to CrossInk units. Supporting a second firmware
  again means a second kind, not a variant of this one.

- **`migrate_retired_sticky_kinds` moves instances off the retired ids** at startup, before the
  loader scan, since an instance pointing at a kind the catalog no longer carries doesn't load and
  the device 404s. The panel block moves with it: instances carry a copy of their kind's panel, so
  a device left on the retired `portrait_flipped` would paint every frame 180 degrees out. Fields
  the operator changed are left alone, same rule as a kind heal. A retired mono instance also
  picks up `gray_4`, since the successor packs 2-bpp and has no 1-bpp variant.

  Done as a migration rather than `deprecated_aliases` deliberately. Under an alias both ids
  resolve to the same object, so the old kind's panel *is* the new kind's, and a stale
  `portrait_flipped` on an instance would read as a deliberate operator override and survive.

## [0.343.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`seeed_reterminal_sticky` device kind.** A Seeed reTerminal Sticky running the
  tesserae-device-firmware build, confirmed on real hardware. The wire format is byte-identical to
  `seeed_reterminal_e1001_gray`: exactly 96000 bytes (800*480/4), row-major from top-left, 4 pixels
  per byte MSB first, 2-bit `0b00` black to `0b11` white. The renderer and packer are shared
  unchanged.

  `orientation` is `portrait`, not the `portrait_flipped` the existing CrossInk Sticky entries
  declare. The controller scans 800x480 landscape and the glass is mounted at 90 degrees, so the
  firmware transposes on the device and the server renders ordinary 480x800 portrait. That mapping
  was pinned on hardware rather than inherited. `seeed_sticky` and `seeed_sticky_gray` are
  unchanged and continue to serve CrossInk units, which composite a base frame plus two planes and
  may map the panel the other way round.

  Declares `touch: true`, so tap dispatch and the editors' Interaction UI apply to it. A room
  panel that shows what's on next and takes a booking tap is the case this matters for.

  Carries `auto_select: false`. On the wire this SKU is indistinguishable from `xteink_x4_gray`:
  same protocol, gamut, 480x800 geometry and byte count. A device running this firmware names its
  own kind at register and discover, but relay pairing infers a SKU from the wire signature
  instead, and this id sorts ahead of `xteink_x4_gray` in that tie-break. Without the flag an
  Xteink X4 pairing over a relay would be relabelled a reTerminal Sticky, the failure v0.321.3
  fixed for `seeed_sticky_gray`.

- **`touch` documented in `schema/hardware.schema.json`.** The key has gated touch dispatch and the
  Interaction UI since #49, but was absent from the schema, so a manifest author had no way to know
  it existed. Additional properties are permitted, so it validated either way and a SKU with a
  digitizer silently came out untappable.

### Fixed

- **A healed device kept its old kind's panel.** `create_instance` copies the kind's panel block
  into the instance file, and an instance's panel overrides its kind's, so moving a device to the
  kind its firmware now declares left it describing the previous board. The heal rewrote `kind` and
  dropped a stale `renderer_id` but never touched `panel`.

  Mostly invisible between siblings that share a panel, and wrong in two ways that are not. A
  Sticky healing from `seeed_sticky_gray` to `seeed_reterminal_sticky` kept `portrait_flipped` and
  painted every frame 180 degrees out on a panel that was otherwise working. Worse, the case the
  heal was written for, a device pairing under a generic protocol kind and coming back announcing
  its SKU, kept the generic kind's 800x480 landscape default: `esp32_client` healing to
  `seeed_reterminal_e1004` rendered at 800x480 instead of 1200x1600 portrait.

  Panel fields still equal to the old kind's value now move to the new kind's. Fields the user
  changed are left alone, so a deliberate per-display override survives; same reasoning as the
  stale `renderer_id` drop it sits beside.

## [0.342.0], 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`crosspoint_gray` device kind.** A CrossPoint e-reader painting a Tesserae dashboard as its
  sleep screen over the LAN, with no cloud component. The reader draws the image twice, through
  its greyscale LSB and MSB planes, quantising each pixel to 0-3, so the kind declares a 480x800
  portrait panel on the `gray_4` gamut. Registering as a generic CircuitPython client left the
  panel on a mono default and those levels were discarded server-side, before the file was
  written.

  The renderer is shared with the CircuitPython kinds rather than forked: it selects its palette
  from the bound panel's gamut, so the same pipeline emits four levels here and one bit elsewhere,
  and the wire format (uncompressed indexed BMP) is identical. Verified end to end: a gradient
  comes back as 4 bpp, uncompressed, 480x800, under 190 KiB, with exactly four grey values.

- **`GET /frame.bmp` honours `?button=`.** The route previously served the newest stored render
  and nothing else, so a client whose only interaction is "download my sleep screen" saw the same
  bytes for ever: `/frame` hands back the last rendered artefact and the re-render checks hang off
  the poll. A button now dispatches synchronously before the artefact is chosen, exactly as on the
  poll, and the frame it produces is what that same response carries. Both routes share one
  dispatch helper so they cannot drift, including the `event` alias older firmware sends.

  `frames.json` entries carry `button=refresh` for the same reason; without it the on-device
  picker links to a frame that may be hours old.

- **`frame.bmp` answers a `Range: bytes=0-0` probe** with a `206` and one byte, so a reachability
  check does not pull a whole image through a client-side relay that may cap well below the frame
  size. Any other range falls through to the full body, which is a valid answer to any range
  request. `HEAD` is deliberately not the mechanism: it promises a Content-Length with no body,
  which such a relay reports as truncated.

## [0.341.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **A relay refusal says why.** Registering an install against a relay reported only
  `POST https://... -> 400`. The relay had already explained itself in the JSON error body it
  returns, and the client parsed that body for its `code` and then discarded the human-readable
  `message`. The message now reaches the error, truncated, so an operator sees
  `-> 400: install_pubkey required` rather than a bare status.

- **The relay container logs one line per request.** Method, path and status. Without it a refusal
  was invisible from the relay side: an operator had only whatever status their Tesserae install
  reported and nothing to compare it against, which matters most when something between the two,
  such as a reverse proxy, is the thing refusing. Paths only, never query strings or headers,
  since tokens live in both.

## [0.340.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **A widget that serves its own media renders again (#255).** v0.329.0 put plugin blueprint
  routes behind the password gate, exempting only the static asset handler and endpoints a plugin
  declared through `RENDER_SAFE_ENDPOINTS`. An installed catalog widget that serves artwork from
  its own blueprint therefore had that fetch refused during a render, which happens over loopback
  with no session, and every panel drew a broken image. The declaration is an in-tree convention
  its author never saw, and the widget is not in this repository, so the sweep that added it for
  Picture Gallery could not have found it.

  A **read** of a plugin's own sub-route is allowed from loopback again. Read-only is the line
  that keeps the original hole shut: every dangerous route found when this was tightened was a
  mutation (a gallery folder delete calling `shutil.rmtree`, calendar feed writes, CalDAV
  discovery against a caller-supplied URL), and those stay refused. A plugin's index stays refused
  even on a read, since it lists loader errors and plugin contents and gtfs turns a query argument
  on it into an outbound request.

  Narrower than before as a result: a plugin exposing a destructive action over GET would now be
  reachable from loopback. Every such route in this repository is a POST.

## [0.339.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **A cold offline album can sync (#247).** The version announced on `/status` and the version the
  manifest endpoint served were computed from different inputs, so on an album whose frames had
  never been rendered they could not match. `/status` computes without warming, because it runs on
  every heartbeat and must stay cheap, which leaves each frame with an empty digest and
  `cache: false`; the manifest endpoint warms as a side effect of the fetch, which fills both in.
  Both were hashed into the version. Firmware requires the fetched manifest to carry the announced
  version and rejects it otherwise, correctly, since the version is its only guarantee that it is
  caching against what the server currently intends. So every fetch was rejected, nothing cached,
  the frames re-warmed, and the device reported `syncing, 0 of 0` for ever while the event log
  filled with `album_warm`.

  There is now one computation, derived from what a device syncs against: the album identity, its
  ordered frame ids, its fit, and the playback block. Warming cannot move it. `/status` no longer
  builds a manifest to get there, so the heartbeat path stops walking frames and stat-ing
  artifacts entirely.

  `fit` is newly part of it. Changing it drops the warm cache and re-renders every frame to
  different bytes, and the manifest body never carried it.

  The device's advertised caps are deliberately **not** part of it, though they still shape which
  frames are offered for caching. Including them would let a card swap force a re-sync, but the
  contract describes `capacity_bytes` only as "the storage budget the server plans against" and
  nothing promises it is constant: firmware reporting free rather than total space would move the
  version on every beat, which is a permanent re-sync loop, the same failure this fixes and harder
  to see. Both endpoints now read caps through one helper so they cannot drift either.

## [0.338.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **A render that finishes with broken images now says so (#255).** The image wait resolves on
  `error` as well as `load`, which is right (a dead upstream must not hold a render hostage) but
  meant a page full of broken-image glyphs completed silently: the frame reached the panel, the
  server logged a success, and the only evidence was on the glass. Failed images are now counted
  and named in a warning, and carried in `render_report?debug=1` alongside the existing settle
  timings.

  URLs are logged without their query string. A Home Assistant `entity_picture` carries its auth
  token there, and a diagnostic is not a place to write someone's credential.

## [0.337.0], 2026-08-22

### Added

- **The relay image is published to GHCR.** `ghcr.io/dmellok/tesserae-relay`, multi-arch
  (amd64 + arm64), so self-hosting no longer means cloning the whole repository to build a
  480-line mailbox. `:edge` tracks `main` and every build publishes an immutable `sha-<commit>`
  tag; `:latest` appears with the first tagged relay release.

  The relay is versioned independently of Tesserae, from a `relay-v*` tag. The two are coupled by
  the wire contract rather than a version number, and tagging the image with an application
  version would imply a lockstep that does not exist. Its workflow is path-filtered, so an
  application commit does not rebuild it, and it runs the relay test suite before publishing.

## [0.336.0], 2026-08-22

### Added

- **The relay runs as a container, without Cloudflare (discussion #254).** Self-hosting it
  previously meant deploying the Worker to your own Cloudflare account. It now also runs on Node
  with the filesystem standing in for R2: `docker build -t tesserae-relay packages/relay`, or
  `npm start` on any machine with Node 18 or newer.

  The same `src/index.js` runs in both deployments. The Cloudflare coupling was only ever the R2
  binding used as a blob store (`get`, `put`, `delete`, `list`) plus an optional analytics
  binding, so the container swaps the backend rather than forking the Worker. The wire contract is
  unchanged, which means a panel paired against one relay reaches the other by changing its base
  URL, with no firmware change.

  Two differences the container handles itself. Cloudflare provides public HTTPS; a container
  wants TLS in front of it, so it speaks plain HTTP and answers `GET /healthz`. And where the
  Worker deployment expires abandoned pairing records with an R2 lifecycle rule, the container
  sweeps `code/` and `pair/` in-process every hour against the `expires_at` the records already
  carry. Frame blobs self-clean on upload in both.

  `packages/relay` also gains a `test` script; the suite runs on plain `node --test` with no
  wrangler or Miniflare, and now covers the storage backend, the HTTP bridge, and the sweep.

## [0.335.0], 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Add a REST device without pairing (discussion #240).** Pairing needs the device to run the
  `/register` handshake, which a digital sign, a browser tab, or a photo frame never will: they
  only fetch an image URL. Those still have to exist as a device so a page can target them and
  `/preview/<id>.png` follows their lineup. The REST branch of Add device now carries an "Add
  without pairing" form with the same fields as the MQTT one; it puts the instance on the REST
  transport and mints its access token in one step. Adding without that field still reads as MQTT,
  so the existing path is unchanged.

## [0.334.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **The day calendar no longer draws tomorrow's events across today (#248).** The widget fetches a
  rolling window from now, `hours_ahead` wide, so the 24 hour default reaches into tomorrow.
  All-day events were filtered to the day being drawn; timed events were not, so an event moved to
  tomorrow stayed in today's list. Drawn against today's 0-24 axis it hit the clamp meant for
  events that overlap today (an overnight shift, a multi-day trip), whose rule reads "neither edge
  is today" as "runs straight through today", and painted the whole column while its label still
  read the real 10:00-11:00. It looked like today's copy had gone stale, which is also why the
  week view disagreed: that one buckets by date and was correct. Timed events are now filtered to
  the day being drawn, and the client refuses to clamp an event that does not touch that day.
  Overnight and multi-day events that genuinely occupy today are unaffected.

  One consequence worth knowing: `hours_ahead` above 24 no longer shows anything extra, because
  the widget draws a single day's axis and anything beyond it is filtered out.

## [0.333.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **The admin UI no longer stalls behind abandoned device streams.** A device that reopened
  `/stream` faster than the keepalive interval stacked one waitress thread per attempt. The SSE
  generator only learns its client has gone when a write fails, and between writes it slept
  holding the connection, so at a 25 second keepalive and a ~1.6 second reconnect loop roughly 16
  of 24 threads sat on connections nobody was reading, each still scanning server state and
  issuing Home Assistant queries every 2 seconds. Page loads queued behind them for 9 to 23
  seconds. There is now at most one live stream per device (a new connection retires the older
  one) and the keepalive is 5 seconds, so a dead peer is reaped promptly.

- **OpenDisplay Home Assistant telemetry works at all.** The poller runs on its own thread, where
  there is no Flask application context, and the Home Assistant query it makes needs one. Every
  poll raised "Working outside of application context" and was swallowed at DEBUG, so the
  integration had never once recorded a reading. A poll where every configured tag fails now logs
  a warning rather than leaving a total failure invisible.

- **An always-on panel's polls are no longer scored against a wake prediction.** Such a device has
  no wake to predict, so every poll read as a missed prediction and reset smart-sync confidence
  repeatedly for a device behaving correctly. Nothing consumed the prediction for it either.

### Changed

- **A firmware kind with no release feed is re-checked every 12 hours instead of every hour.** A
  404 is a stable fact about the kind, not a transient failure.

## [0.332.0], 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **An always-on panel now polls on its awake cadence instead of its panel refresh floor.** A
  reTerminal E1003 set to stay awake with a 5 second cadence was told to poll every 60, so a
  manual Send took up to a minute to appear. The cause was `refresh_floor_s`, which describes how
  fast the *glass* can be repainted, being applied to how often the device *asks*. A poll is a
  conditional GET that answers 304 while the frame is unchanged, and a 304 never reaches the
  panel, so the two limits are about different things. The awake cadence is now used as-is.

  The 30 second content-poll floor also no longer applies to an always-on device. It exists to
  stop a sleeping panel spinning its radio up for a change it could have waited for; a panel that
  never sleeps is already associated, and holding it there discarded the pull-forward the floor
  sits inside. Deep-sleeping devices are unchanged, floor included.

## [0.331.0], 2026-08-22

### Added

- **`GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame.bmp` serves the frame's bytes directly.** The normal frame path
  is a two-hop envelope: JSON naming a content-addressed artefact, then a fetch of that URL. Some
  clients cannot walk it. An e-reader pulling a dashboard as its sleep screen does so from a
  declarative download handler that makes exactly one request, follows no redirects, and cannot
  attach headers of its own. This route answers that shape: stable URL, image in the body, no
  redirect. It serves an uncompressed indexed BMP whatever the device's configured frame format
  is, so adding it changes nothing for that device's existing client; the same composition is
  re-transformed into a second, decoder-free container.

  The route never answers `2xx` without a complete body. Such clients stream to a temporary file
  and rename it over the live sleep screen on any `2xx`, so a `204`, or a `200` with an empty body,
  would replace a working screen with a zero-byte file. "No frame yet" is a `404` rather than the
  `204` the envelope route uses, a failed conversion is a `5xx`, and a body over the client's 1 MB
  download cap is refused with the measured size rather than served for the client to fail on.

- **`GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frames.json` lists pullable frames for an on-device picker**, so a
  reader can fetch a dashboard on demand without a computer in the loop.

### Changed

- **Those two routes also accept the device token as `?k=<token>`.** The download handlers they
  exist for own the request and cannot set headers, so the URL is the only channel. Opt-in per
  route rather than a global auth change: a token in a query string lands in access logs, proxy
  logs and browser history in a way a header does not, so it stays confined to the routes with no
  alternative. Headers still win when both are present, and every other endpoint remains
  header-only.

## [0.330.0], 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Mains-powered panels can stay awake.** The 30-second floor under the sleep interval exists so
  a typo can't flatten a battery, and every reachability limit follows from deep sleep: a Send, a
  schedule fire or a touch cannot reach a sleeping device, so it lands whenever the panel next
  happens to wake. A panel on a wall socket is paying that cost for a guarantee it doesn't need.
  Devices whose firmware advertises `can_stay_awake` are now offered a Stay awake switch and an
  awake poll interval (5-300s, default 15s) on their device card. With it on, `next_poll_s` is
  derived from the awake cadence rather than the sleep interval and the 30-second content-poll
  floor no longer applies, so a server that knows content is about to change can hand back
  intervals in the single-digit seconds. A panel's declared `refresh_floor_s` is enforced here,
  which is the first path that could ask for a cadence under 30s.

  The switch is gated on the advertised capability rather than on the model, because a reTerminal
  on USB and the same board on its battery are the same kind, and only the firmware can tell them
  apart. Server-side support only; firmware handoff in
  `notes/design-handoffs/firmware-always-on-prompt.md`.

### Changed

- **Smart sync no longer holds renders for an always-on device.** It exists to time a render to
  land just before a panel wakes, which has no meaning when the panel is reachable continuously;
  holding would only delay a frame the device could already have collected. Bound schedules and
  rotations fire on their own cadence instead, and the device card explains why rather than
  leaving the panel on "warming up" forever.

## [0.329.0], 2026-08-22

### Security

- **Plugin routes no longer answer unauthenticated requests from loopback.** The exemption that
  lets the in-process renderer fetch `/plugins/<id>/client.js` without a session was matched by
  path shape, and plugin-provided blueprints mount under that same prefix, so every route a plugin
  registered inherited it: Picture Gallery folder deletes, Calendar feed writes, and CalDAV
  discovery against a caller-supplied URL were all reachable with no password. Loopback is not
  only the operator: the screenshot and remote-image flows run Chromium with local addresses
  allowed and no request interceptor, so a rendered page could POST to `127.0.0.1` itself, and
  there are no CSRF tokens behind the gate. The exemption is now matched on the resolved endpoint
  and covers only the static asset handler, whose own allowlist bounds what it serves.

### Added

- **Plugins can declare `RENDER_SAFE_ENDPOINTS`.** A widget whose markup points at its own
  plugin's media route needs that route served during a session-less render. Picture Gallery
  declares its two read-only image endpoints; anything undeclared stays behind the gate.

## [0.328.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Resync an offline album from Settings → Devices (#247).** The collection version is a digest
  of the manifest content, so it moves only when the album does. That leaves no lever for the case
  where server and device disagree for a reason the content cannot express: an interrupted sync, a
  swapped card, frames the device dropped. Until now the only workaround was editing the album, a
  real change made for a fake reason. Resync folds a per-device token into the version after the
  content digest, so the manifest body stays byte-identical and only the version the device
  compares against moves. Firmware needs no support for it; it looks like an ordinary content
  change. The device acts on it at its next wake, not immediately.

- **The album line shows before a device has reported.** It previously required a matching
  playback report, so a fresh binding, or one whose device had gone quiet, showed nothing at all.
  The line now appears whenever an enabled album is bound, with the state pill replaced by "no
  report yet" until one arrives, and it carries the Resync control.

## [0.327.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **The offline-album sync path says what it did (#247).** It was almost entirely silent on the
  happy path, so a device that never requested a manifest and a device that requested one and got
  nothing usable looked identical in a journal. The manifest endpoint now logs the device, album,
  version and frame count, and the builder logs how many frames are cacheable.

- **`SyslogIdentifier=tesserae` in the generated systemd unit (#247).** journald tagged every line
  `python[<pid>]`, which is indistinguishable from any other Python on the machine. Existing
  installs pick this up by re-running `scripts/install-systemd.sh`.

### Fixed

- **Frames that could not be rendered were reported as exceeding the device's caps.** Two different
  situations: being over a device's `max_frames` or byte budget is expected on a large album, while
  having no render at all is a fault that leaves the frame unfetchable. They shared one log line, so
  the second was invisible.

## [0.326.2], 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Formatting only: `tests/test_device_telemetry.py` was left unformatted in 0.326.1, failing
  `ruff format --check` in CI. No behaviour change.

## [0.326.1], 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **A device read as overdue after its sleep interval was changed (#246).** The wake prediction is
  stored when a heartbeat arrives, derived from the interval configured at that moment. Editing the
  interval afterwards left the old prediction in place, so a panel moved from 1 minute to 1 hour
  looked overdue for the best part of an hour, and the scheduler aimed its smart-sync render at a
  time already past. Saving a device now re-derives the prediction from its last heartbeat. A
  firmware-published `sleep_until` / `next_sleep_s` is left alone, since the device's own statement
  outranks a server setting; the telemetry entry records which of the two it holds. Confidence
  resets on reprojection, because past on-time wakes say nothing about a cadence that just changed.

- **Offline albums offered frames the device could not fetch (#247).** Frames are addressed by
  digest, and a frame that failed to render carried an empty digest and measured zero bytes, so it
  always fit the capacity budget and was always marked `cache: true`. The device was told to cache
  something it had no way to request, cached nothing, and reported "0 of N frames cached" while the
  server kept re-offering the same set. A frame with no digest is now never offered for caching.

## [0.326.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **calendar_core records why a fetch failed.** The fetch path knew whether a feed was reachable
  and threw it away, so a 401 was indistinguishable from a calendar with no events, and anything
  reading that feed showed an empty result as though it were the truth. Outcomes now go to
  `feed_health.json` next to the feed cache: last success, the reason for the current failure, and
  how long it has been failing. Written only when a fetch is genuinely attempted, which the cache
  TTL bounds to once per feed per 15 minutes, so it is not hot-path I/O.

- **Settings → Rooms shows feed health and what's on next (#90).** A room whose feed is failing says
  so on its row, with the reason, instead of appearing to be a free room. The Next column shows the
  current booking's end or the next one's start.

  Next is read only when the feed's cache is already warm. A settings page must not make one network
  call per room to render, so a cold feed shows a dash rather than blocking the page on up to a
  15 second timeout each. The dash means "not known right now", never "free".

## [0.325.0], 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Settings → Rooms redesigned (#90).** The page rendered every room as a fully expanded
  nine-field form stacked vertically, so eight rooms was eight identical forms with nothing
  scannable and the add form buried at the bottom. A room is configured once and then checked on,
  so the page is now a list of state: one row per room stating its feed, panels, booking method and
  dashboard status, with editing behind a disclosure. Adding a room moved to the top and asks for
  two fields instead of nine; everything else is set on the row afterwards.

  Panels are checkbox cards rather than a `<select multiple>`, which hides its own state and is
  hard to operate on a phone. Removing a room is a guarded disclosure, and deleting its dashboard
  stays a separate, never-preselected choice. No state is conveyed by colour alone: every one is an
  icon plus a word. Works without JavaScript throughout; the three per-room actions remain three
  separate forms, linked by the button `form=` attribute rather than nested.

  Below 720px the column headers drop and each row restates its facts with its own inline labels
  ("Feed …", "Panels 2", "Booking Off"), since there are no headers left to read them against. A
  failing feed leads that list, being the reason someone opened the page.

- **A room has one booking method instead of two independent fields.** `book_url` and
  `book_caldav` could both be set, and neither the model nor the UI said which won. They are
  replaced by `booking_mode` (`none` / `endpoint` / `caldav`). Existing rooms migrate on load,
  resolving the ambiguity the way dispatch actually did: the CalDAV toggle won over a URL.

  When a room's feed cannot be written to, the CalDAV option is disabled with the reason beside it
  naming the feed, rather than a footnote. An `.ics` URL is read-only whatever credentials it
  carries.

## [0.324.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Room board (#90).** Settings → Rooms builds one dashboard carrying a row per enabled room, for
  a lobby or corridor display. It needs no widget of its own: a board is a generated page with a
  `room_status` cell per room, so it inherits every fix the widget gets. Booking is off on a board,
  because a tap would book whichever room the finger landed on. Rebuild after adding or removing a
  room, since the row geometry depends on how many there are.

- **Booking from a room panel (#90).** Set a room's booking endpoint and its panel shows a book
  button; a tap POSTs there and repaints a few seconds later, so the panel shows the room it just
  booked. The room id rides in the query string (`?room=kestrel`), because the webhook payload
  carries the device and, only for a rotation-bound page, a page id; a room panel is normally bound
  directly, so one endpoint serving several rooms could not otherwise tell which was tapped. An
  operator's own query string is preserved.

- **Book a room directly over CalDAV (#90).** A room whose feed was added by CalDAV discovery and
  carries a username and password can be booked with no endpoint in between: a tap writes the event
  into the room's own calendar. New `room_book:<id>` action, side-effecting like the webhook
  actions, so widget markup cannot aim it.

  One `PUT` of one `VEVENT`, reusing the collection URL, credentials and HTTP opener `calendar_core`
  already stored, so no new credential storage and no new auth surface. Basic and digest only,
  covering Radicale, Baikal, Nextcloud and iCloud app passwords; Google and Microsoft 365 need OAuth
  with a registered application and use a booking endpoint instead. `If-None-Match: *` makes it a
  create, never an overwrite, so a collision fails rather than replacing an existing meeting.
  Availability is not pre-checked: between checking and writing someone else can book anyway, and
  the calendar server is the only thing that can arbitrate.

- **Rooms documentation** at `docs/install/rooms.md`: setup, the shared-calendar location filter,
  the board, what a booking endpoint receives, the CalDAV requirements, and why `POST /api/v1/push`
  from the receiving server beats the timed repaint.

### Fixed

- **CalDAV write failures pointed at the wrong problem.** Found by running the booking path against
  a real Radicale server rather than a stub. A collection that doesn't exist answers `409`, not
  `404`, and was falling through to a bare "the calendar returned HTTP 409"; it now says no calendar
  exists at that address, which is the likeliest real misconfiguration. A `403` was reported as
  rejected credentials, sending an operator to re-check a password that was never wrong; it now says
  the login was accepted and the write refused. `401` keeps the credentials message.

## [0.323.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **Rooms (#90, phase 1).** Settings → Rooms. A room names a calendar feed, the panels showing
  it, and optionally an endpoint that books it, then generates its dashboard. Twelve rooms used to
  mean twelve hand-composed pages with the same widget options retyped into each.

  Rooms is a generator, not a runtime. It writes an ordinary page, with an ordinary widget in an
  ordinary cell, bound to ordinary devices, and stops; nothing renders through a room. It holds
  configuration and never a booking, so Tesserae does not become the source of truth for whether a
  room is free, and does not inherit the availability contract that would come with it. Deleting
  the feature would leave every generated page working exactly as a hand-composed one does.

  Regenerating preserves what rooms does not own: theme, style and font survive a rename, so
  restyling a room's dashboard to match the rest of an office is not reverted. Removing a room
  offers to remove its dashboard, and refuses to touch a page it did not generate.

## [0.322.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **A widget can declare when its own data goes stale (#243).** `next_poll_s` was derived from
  schedules and rotation steps only, so anything whose displayed state turns over on its own clock
  was invisible: a room going free at 15:00, a bin collection at dawn, a countdown hitting zero. A
  widget's `fetch()` may now return `next_change_at` (ISO 8601 or a unix timestamp); the composer
  records the soonest across the page, and the status path folds it in beside the schedule
  projection under the same ceiling, floor and margin. The two sources are gathered independently,
  so a scheduler fault no longer discards the widget's hint along with its own.
- **A frame invalidated by a declared change is re-rendered on the next poll (#243).** Waking at the
  right instant achieved nothing on its own, because `/frame` returns the last rendered artefact: a
  panel told to come back at 15:00:20 would collect the frame composed at 14:45. When a declared
  change is in the past and the stored frame predates it, the poll re-renders before serving. The
  hint is consumed on the way out, so it is at most one synchronous render per change, never per
  poll.
- **`plugin:<id>` capability delegation (#244).** A widget that fetches through another plugin makes
  no requests of its own, but the delegate's request runs inside the widget's capability scope, so
  declaring any `requires:` entry got the widget denied at the socket layer for a host it cannot
  know. The only working declaration was no declaration, which is the opposite of what the catalog
  asks for. `plugin:<other_id>` now means "that plugin's declared hosts are allowed while I run":
  narrower than `network:*`, visible in review, and bounded by the delegate's own declaration. An
  undeclared or missing delegate grants nothing, so it cannot be used to inherit a legacy plugin's
  implicit pass, and cycles terminate.

## [0.321.3], 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **Relay pairing could resolve an Xteink X4 to the new Seeed Sticky grayscale SKU.** The two are
  indistinguishable on the wire: same `esp32_bw_client` protocol, same `gray_4` gamut, same 480x800
  declared panel, same `esp32_gray2_bin` renderer, byte-identical frames. With nothing in the
  self-report to separate them, the id sort that settles ties handed the announcement to
  `seeed_sticky_gray`, which would have pinned a confirmed X4 to an unconfirmed SKU's OTA lineage.
  `seeed_sticky_gray` now declares `auto_select: false`, the mechanism already used for the E1001's
  two grayscale glass variants, so an ambiguous report keeps resolving to `xteink_x4_gray` and a
  real Sticky reaches the kind by declaring it at register or discover.

## [0.321.2], 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **Guards against the action-surface drift that caused the 0.321.1 fixes.** A button/touch
  action has to be declared in four places (the registry, the touch editor's hardcoded picker,
  the side-effecting set behind the provenance gate, and the feedback classifier), and missing
  one failed silently. Missing the provenance-gate entry failed silently *and* opened a hole.
  Tests now assert every registered action is offered in the picker, is explicitly classified as
  side-effecting or safe, and has a feedback type, so a new action forces a decision on each
  surface instead of inheriting a default.

## [0.321.1], 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- **`webhook_refresh` was missing from the provenance gate.** `SIDE_EFFECTING_ACTIONS` still
  listed only `webhook` and `ha`, so a `webhook_refresh:` spec coming from raw widget markup
  passed the origin check that exists to stop markup aiming HTTP requests. Both the build-time
  manifest filter and the dispatch-time gate read that set, so the hole was present on both
  paths. Config-declared actions were always fine; only markup origin was affected.
- **`webhook_refresh` was absent from the touch editor's action dropdown.** The tap/swipe picker
  in `static/touch_interaction.js` carries its own hardcoded list rather than reading the action
  registry, so the action could be set through a device's `button_map` or the API but not chosen
  in the UI.
- **`webhook_refresh` fell through to `nav` feedback classification**, so a tap on one showed
  navigation affordance instead of the webhook one. Now classified alongside `webhook`.
- Added to the MCP action vocabulary (`/api/mcp/actions/describe`), which previously documented
  `webhook` alone.

## [0.321.0], 2026-08-21

### Added

- **`webhook_refresh:<url>` button action (#242).** Fires the same POST as `webhook:`, then
  re-renders and repaints the panel a few seconds later, for buttons whose webhook changes the
  state the dashboard reads: book a room, toggle a door, file a ticket. Plain `webhook:` is
  fire-and-forget and leaves the panel showing pre-action state until its next wake, which on a
  deep-sleeping panel can be a long time. The repaint is deliberately delayed rather than
  immediate: the POST carries no acknowledgement, so rendering inside the wake would usually read
  the receiver's pre-action state and repaint the same frame. Default wait is 5 s, configurable
  via `button_webhook_refresh_delay_s`; a burst of presses coalesces into one repaint. Existing
  `webhook:` buttons are unchanged and still never repaint. Works in touch regions as well as
  physical button maps, since both validate against the same action registry.

## [0.320.1], 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- **Client-protocol guidance on sizing `sleep_interval_s` was left describing the old behaviour.**
  It still advised setting the interval to the refresh cadence you wanted and accepting the
  `304`s, which the projection work in 0.320.0 inverts: the interval is now a backstop, and
  setting it well above the schedule interval lets the schedule drive the wakes. Replaced with a
  sizing section covering what the ceiling actually covers (manual Send, webhooks, Home Assistant
  events) and the case with no schedule bound at all, where it remains the refresh cadence.

## [0.320.0], 2026-08-20

### Changed

- **`next_poll_s` now means "new content is probably available then" (#241).** It previously
  only ever echoed the device's configured `sleep_interval_s`, which knows nothing about when
  the dashboard actually changes: a panel on a 15-minute grid against a 07:00 daily schedule
  burned 95 wakes to catch one change, and could see it up to 15 minutes late. The REST status
  path now consults the same projection engine that already backs the Companion API and the
  scheduler, and pulls the returned value forward to the next due schedule or rotation step,
  plus a margin so the client doesn't poll into the middle of the render. The configured
  interval stays the ceiling and is never extended, since manual Send, webhooks, Home Assistant
  events and data-change refreshes have no schedule to project. `estimated` projections are
  ignored. Purely server-side: clients already honouring `next_poll_s` get the benefit with no
  firmware change, and clients ignoring it are unaffected.

### Fixed

- **CircuitPython renderers marked as partially tested.** `circuitpython_bmp` is confirmed on
  Pi-class hardware through the displayio PyGame emulation path; the compatibility matrix still
  listed it as untested. Held short of Tested because the microcontroller route via
  `adafruit_imageload` is unverified.

## [0.319.0], 2026-08-19

### Added

- **Hardware catalog entry for the Seeed XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel (C3).** Seeed's integrated
  7.5" panel with an ESP32-C3 on board, supported by device-firmware from v1.16.0. Registers as
  `xiao_epaper_panel_75_c3` on the `esp32_bw_client` protocol with the `esp32_bw_bin` renderer,
  unchanged: the frame is the same 48000-byte 1-bpp mono buffer the `xiao_epaper_75` kit and the
  reTerminal E1001 already take. It needs its own kind rather than an alias because the kind id
  names the OTA lineage and the two firmware images are not interchangeable. Panels running this
  firmware could announce but not be registered, because nothing in the catalog matched the kind
  they reported.

### Changed

- **The three XIAO 7.5" kinds now read differently in the kind picker.** Two separate products
  share this glass, and a third entry covers one of them on TRMNL BYOS firmware, so the names
  had converged to the point of being unpickable. They are now "XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel (C3)"
  (integrated, Tesserae firmware), "XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel (C3, TRMNL BYOS)" (same hardware,
  TRMNL firmware), and "XIAO ePaper 7.5" (S3, mono)" (the ESP32-S3 Plus driver board sold as
  the TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY Kit). The S3 entry's product link pointed at the C3 panel's page and
  now points at the kit it actually describes. Kind ids are unchanged, so existing devices are
  unaffected.

## [0.318.0], 2026-08-18

### Added

- **A `/discover` claim says when the server kept a different device id.** The MAC is the
  identity on that path, so announcing a new `device_id` for an already-registered MAC hands
  back the stored id and its token rather than renaming anything. That's what lets a re-flashed
  board re-acquire, but the response never said so, and a client that missed the echoed id kept
  talking about a device the server doesn't have. The claim response now carries
  `device_id_changed` (plus `announced_device_id` when it did), sends
  `X-Tesserae-Device-Id` / `X-Tesserae-Device-Id-Changed` headers so a client can branch without
  parsing JSON, and logs the mismatch at WARNING. Still a `200`: the device is paired and its
  token works. Both headers are sent on every claim, so an absent header means an older server
  rather than "unchanged". (#239)

## [0.317.0], 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Companion can securely register a physically nearby display during
  Bluetooth setup.** Authenticated app sessions with `device_setup:write` may
  mint a short-lived, single-use firmware registration code through
  `POST /api/app/v1/device-pairings`. Firmware still redeems that code through
  the existing device registration endpoint, so the app never receives a
  display token. Each Companion session keeps at most one unredeemed code;
  requesting another invalidates the previous one. Existing Companion sessions
  require an explicit operator grant; new pairings include the setup permission.

## [0.316.0], 2026-08-18

### Added

- **A dashboard's settings open in the composer**, in the same slide-out the
  source config uses, so the values it asks for can be changed without leaving
  the canvas. The fields are the same ones the standalone settings page renders,
  and saving re-reads the dashboard from the server rather than trusting the
  editor's in-memory copy, so the rewritten element options show up immediately
  instead of arriving as an "changed externally" prompt.

### Fixed

- **The Dashboards list stays aligned when a dashboard has settings.** The row's
  actions are anchored to the right, so a button that only some rows carried
  shifted Edit and Push sideways on those rows. Every row now reserves the slot
  and only the rows with settings fill it.

## [0.315.1], 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- **Agents are told about a dashboard's settings surface.** The MCP handshake
  instructions now cover declaring `inputs` and that `patch_canvas` accepts them
  on their own, so the one-call path for declaring settings after the elements
  are placed is discoverable. The bridge serves per-tool descriptions from its
  own package, so this had to reach agents through the server-fetched
  instructions rather than a tool description.

## [0.315.0], 2026-08-18

### Added

- **A freeform dashboard can carry its own settings page.** A canvas declares
  the values it asks for (`canvas.inputs`), and `/pages/canvas/c/<id>/configure`
  renders one field per declared setting, pre-filled from what the dashboard is
  currently rendering. An agent building a dashboard over MCP declares these as
  it goes, so whoever inherits it changes the API endpoint or the postcode on a
  settings page instead of hunting through per-element option drawers. A
  dashboard that never declared any can derive them: Suggest settings runs the
  Share flow's own analysis, so whatever would be redacted and asked of an
  installer becomes a setting here. The declaration is the same shape the
  template format already used, so a dashboard configured locally asks an
  installer exactly what its author was asked.

### Fixed

- **A sensitive option that has to stay readable no longer renders as a
  password box.** The `secret` flag on a widget option was answering two
  questions at once: keep this out of the render context and off the
  marketplace, and hide it from the person editing it. Those diverge on a URL,
  which is install-specific and can carry a key in its query string yet cannot
  be maintained when masked, so masking moves to its own `mask` key that
  defaults to `secret`. The REST / JSON service's URL opts out and is editable
  again (#237).

## [0.314.0], 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Apple Health seven-day summaries can now be published through Companion.**
  Servers advertise the opt-in `health.summary` source, strictly validate its
  bounded Activity, Sleep, and Workout sections, retain only the latest
  publisher-isolated snapshot until expiry, and emit source-wide semantic
  refresh events without putting raw Health values in logs, API errors, or
  backups.

### Fixed

- **Prioritised multi-select lists can actually be reordered.** Checked rows
  now expose a drag handle that works with a mouse, touch, or pen, plus arrow,
  Home, and End keys for precise accessible movement. The new DOM order is
  submitted immediately, so priority-based widgets such as Album Art evaluate
  Home Assistant entities in the order shown by the editor. Reordering keeps
  the handle focused across the move, so arrow keys step an entry more than
  once and ticking a row doesn't drop keyboard focus to the page.
## [0.313.0], 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Custom request headers on webpage renders**, so a dashboard behind a bearer
  token or an API key can be put on a panel without making it public (#234).
  Available on the Webpage widget, on Send → Webpage, and on
  `POST /api/app/v1/webpages`. The shape is a JSON object, matching the
  `headers` option `rest_service` already uses rather than inventing a second
  convention:

  ```json
  {"Authorization": "Bearer …", "X-API-Key": "…"}
  ```

  `User-Agent` is accepted and becomes the browser identity for that capture
  rather than staying a header, so a site that checks `navigator.userAgent`
  client-side sees the same value that went on the wire. That covers services
  which reject unknown clients, though as noted in #178 it will not get past
  protections that also inspect TLS fingerprints.

  **Headers are scoped to the target URL's own origin.** They are attached by
  Chromium's request interceptor, not set on the browser context, because a
  context header goes to every origin the page touches: on a dashboard render
  that is every other widget's upstream. Origin scoping means a credential
  cannot reach a third-party subresource, another cell's service, or wherever a
  redirect points next, and it makes that a property of the mechanism rather
  than a rule to remember. The SSRF block decision still runs first, so a host
  the guard refuses is never handed headers on the way out.

  Values are never logged, never written to History, and never included in
  error messages; the log line records how many headers and which names. On the
  Send page the field is not remembered between pushes. Transport and
  browser-managed headers (`Host`, `Content-Length`, `Connection`,
  `Transfer-Encoding`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-*`, `Sec-*`, and others) are refused,
  as is any value containing a control character, since a newline would be
  header injection.

  One limitation worth knowing: headers cannot reach the live preview in your
  browser, only the server-side render. A webpage cell may show a 401 in the
  editor and render correctly on the panel.

### Fixed

- **Secret cell options are no longer written into the composed page.**
  `compose.html` serialises every cell's options into a `data-options`
  attribute for client-side widgets to read, without regard for the manifest's
  `secret` flag, so a credential stored on a cell was readable in the composed
  DOM. Reachable only over loopback, and template export already redacted these
  before sharing, so nothing could leave an install; but it put a token
  somewhere it had no reason to be, and anything reading page source (render
  reports, diagnostics) would capture it. Secret-flagged options are now
  dropped before the payload reaches the browser. The server-side data fetch
  runs first and still sees the full option set, so `rest_service` is
  unaffected.

## [0.312.1], 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **App-only Docker upgrades download much smaller changed layers.** System
  packages and Python runtime dependencies are installed before the frequently
  changing Tesserae source, and tagged builds can fall back to the `main` build
  cache, so unchanged large layers can be reused when the cache is available.

## [0.312.0], 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Edge handling now reaches CircuitPython clients.** The
  `circuitpython_png` and `circuitpython_bmp` renderers quantise on the
  server but read only fit, contrast and dither mode, so a palette
  profile's "Protect the panel's own colours", "Preserve line-art edges"
  and "Smoothing radius" were resolved, handed over, and dropped. All
  three apply now, using the same helpers and the same meaning as the
  `.bin` packers. Each is a no-op at its default, so a display that has
  never opened that block gets a byte-identical file.

  Tolerance behaves differently here and the difference is worth knowing.
  This path quantises against the gamut's *nominal* palette, so panel
  black is `#000000` rather than a measured `#1F2226`, and a photographic
  near-black sky sits further from it than it would after the calibrated
  pre-pass. Where the `.bin` path wants single digits on photo content,
  this one wants 32 to 48 to catch the same pixels.

  The calibrated palette itself is still not applied on this path: the
  wire palette is a per-gamut contract with the client, and changing it
  would repaint every existing CircuitPython panel. That stays a
  follow-up, and wants to be opt-in per display when it lands.

### Fixed

- **Edge-handling settings were discarded on every edit after the first.**
  The tone editor forks a bundled preset on first tweak and edits the fork
  in place afterwards. The fork path wrote the submitted edge settings; the
  edit-in-place path wrote the *base profile's*, so "Protect the panel's own
  colours", "Preserve line-art edges" and "Smoothing radius" took whatever
  value they were forked with and then silently ignored every later change.
  The only way to move one was to reset the display back to the bundled
  preset and fork again. Tone and dither were unaffected, which is why the
  editor looked like it was saving.

- **The tone editor showed two identical Save buttons.** The inline button
  and the sticky save bar are meant to be alternative affordances, but the
  bar is sticky rather than fixed, so its natural position is a few pixels
  under the inline button and both were on screen together the moment a
  slider moved. The inline button now hands over to the bar while the form
  is dirty, so exactly one Save is visible at a time.

## [0.311.0], 2026-08-17

### Added

- **A per-display timeline of the next visible updates**, at
  `GET /api/app/v1/devices/{device_id}/upcoming` behind the
  `device_timeline` capability. It answers what is expected to change or
  repaint one panel next, when, and why: Lineup advances, Keep Fresh
  re-renders, and Home Return, each with the dashboard it lands on and
  whether the timing is scheduled, conditional, or an estimate.

  The projection replays the running engine's own gates rather than
  walking the stored records, because everything that decides whether an
  update actually reaches the glass lives in the engine: the dwell grid
  and its manual overrides, minimum hold measured window to window,
  per-record cooldowns, daily backfill suppression, Smart Sync, quiet
  hours, and which panel an unbound record resolves to. Anything landing
  inside a display's quiet hours is left out, since it repaints nothing,
  and records due in the same tick are coalesced to the one the panel is
  left showing.

  Dashboard and widget refresh timings are deliberately not included.
  Refresh is becoming event-driven, so covering only its timed half would
  make the timeline quietly incomplete; the `cause` values are reserved so
  adding them later is additive. Manual sends, webhooks, and Home
  Assistant events are not predicted at all.

- **`current_frame_at` on the same response**, so a countdown has a start
  as well as an end. For a REST display it is when the server handed over
  the frame the panel now holds, taken from the delivery-side snapshot
  already persisted next to the served digest, so it survives a restart;
  for other transports it is when the current frame was published. It is
  never a claim that the panel finished repainting, and is null when no
  baseline can be established rather than guessed at.

## [0.309.1], 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Portrait pictures arrived sideways on mono and greyscale ESP32
  panels.** `esp32_bw_bin`, `esp32_gray_bin` and `esp32_gray2_bin` decided
  the quarter turn by comparing the *source image's* aspect with the
  firmware's row stride, so any picture taller than it is wide was turned
  90° on a landscape panel, whether or not the panel wanted a turn. A turn
  belongs to the panel: the upload is now fitted to the display's
  composition first, and rotated only when the composition and the
  hardware stride actually disagree, which is what `esp32_bin` and the
  CircuitPython path already did. Dashboards were unaffected, they arrive
  composition-sized.

## [0.309.0], 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Phone photos landed on their side on Pi panels.** A camera stores a
  landscape pixel buffer plus an EXIF orientation tag rather than rotating
  the pixels. The `.bin` renderers apply that tag inside their own fit,
  but `pi_png` fits client-side and never called it, so the tag was
  dropped on re-encode and the panel painted the photo turned a quarter.
  Orientation is now settled once when the image is taken in, so every
  renderer sees upright pixels and the History thumbnail matches what the
  panel paints.

### Added

- **A rotation control for pushed images**, on the Send page and as
  `rotate` on `POST /api/v1/push/image`. `auto` turns the image a quarter
  when its aspect is the opposite of the panel's, so a portrait photo
  fills a landscape panel instead of arriving as a letterboxed strip;
  `90` / `180` / `270` turn it clockwise regardless. Unset keeps the
  orientation as shot, since an image carrying text is worse rotated than
  letterboxed and nothing here can tell the two apart. A panel that is
  mounted the other way around still wants the display's own Rotation
  setting, which dashboards follow too.

## [0.308.1], 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Uneven gaps between the cards on the Stats page.** Three different
  things were spacing the page: the tiles and sponsor card carried their
  own bottom margins, adjacent section cards get 16px from a global rule,
  and that rule stops applying the moment a wrapper (the two-column grid)
  sits between two cards, which left some seams at zero. The page now
  stacks with a single 16px flex gap and resets the parts that were
  contributing their own, including the adjacent-card rule that outranks a
  plain reset.

## [0.308.0], 2026-08-16

### Added

- **One sponsorship ask, on the Stats page, after a milestone.** A card
  appears once an install has been running a year or has painted 10,000
  frames, on the page someone opened to look at what Tesserae has done for
  them. Fleet size is deliberately not a trigger: panel count can't tell a
  hobbyist with secondhand hardware from a business. Dismissal is
  permanent and silent, with no "remind me later", and the flag lives in
  settings rather than the stats store so deleting the counters can't
  bring the card back. Nothing is gated, delayed, or degraded either way,
  the footer sponsor link is unchanged, and none of this is ever rendered
  to a panel.

## [0.307.0], 2026-08-16

### Added

- **A Stats page, counted and kept on your own server.** The event log is
  capped and rolls over within days, so until now nothing could answer how
  much work an install actually does. `/stats` now shows pushes per day
  grouped by what asked for them, frames painted per display, check-ins,
  render times, outcomes, and a snapshot of what the install is made of.
  Counters are aggregated as events happen into `data/core/stats.db`: one
  row per date, metric, and dimension, with no URLs, dashboard titles,
  push contents, or clock times finer than the day. Nothing reads that
  file except the page and the export button, and the page carries the
  controls to prove it: export the whole store as JSON, pause collecting,
  or delete every counter. Documented under Privacy.

## [0.306.0], 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Flat backgrounds can keep the panel's own colours instead of
  dithering (#227).** A pixel that already sits on one of the panel's
  colours generates no dither error of its own, but it still receives its
  neighbours', so a background beside saturated content gets pushed off
  its colour and speckles. The palette profile's edge section gains
  "Protect the panel's own colours", a tolerance in sRGB distance: above
  0, those pixels keep their colour, and on the error-diffusion dithers
  they stop passing error onward so a protected region can't collect
  error on one side and dump it out the other. The mask is built on the
  tone-mapped source, since exposure, the S-curve and the calibrated
  pre-pass all move the pixels it means to protect. Wired for the colour
  packers and for black-and-white panels, left out of the greyscale ramp
  where nearly every pixel is close to some level and the same guard
  would flatten photographs. Off by default, and off renders exactly as
  before.

## [0.305.0], 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- **Saving an album from the Gallery kept only what that form can edit.** The
  album form builds a whole record from its own fields, so an explicit frame
  order, a disabled album, or an interval that isn't a round number of minutes
  was dropped the next time someone renamed the album or changed its displays.
  All three come from surfaces the form knows nothing about (the MCP tools
  today, the Companion API next), and none of them are the form's to discard.
  A save now carries them across, leaves the interval alone unless the minutes
  field actually changed, and says an album is disabled instead of reporting a
  success about displays it isn't playing on.

## [0.304.0], 2026-08-16

### Added

- **Push a single image from a script (#231).** `POST /api/v1/push/image`
  sends one image straight to named displays, using the same webhook token
  as `POST /api/v1/push`. Until now the only scriptable image push was the
  Companion API, which is a paired-client contract and isn't in the public
  OpenAPI spec, so the obvious place to look didn't have it. Multipart
  upload, required `device_ids`, optional `fit` and History `label`,
  per-device quiet hours honoured (with an `override_quiet_hours` opt-out for
  images that are worth waking a panel for), and a response that names each
  display under `sent`, `quiet` or `failed` rather than leaving a partial
  result to be inferred from a count. Documented in the spec and in the
  OpenAPI guide with a curl recipe.

### Fixed

- **The webhook token's location in the docs was wrong.** The API spec and the
  OpenAPI guide sent people to Settings → Server → App; the token has always
  lived under Settings → System → Webhook.

## [0.303.0], 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **A display plays one offline album at a time, and says so.** Binding a
  display that already plays another album used to save cleanly and then
  resolve to whichever album was found first, so the other silently never
  synced. The album form now refuses the save, names the album holding each
  display, and offers a "take over" tick to move them deliberately. A
  displaced album keeps its remaining displays rather than being deleted.
- **A display that reports a frame cache says how much it holds.** Its
  advertised capacity and frame cap now ride along with the capability state
  in the Companion API, so a client can tell whether a folder fits without
  guessing from the model name. Absent when the display didn't report them.

## [0.302.2], 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Deleting a device takes its own History, not the dashboard's (#229).** A
  push records the dashboard it came from and the displays it reached; the
  wipe only looked at the dashboard. Deleting one display off a shared
  dashboard left its pushes behind, and deleting the last display then removed
  every row for that dashboard, including the first display's. Rows delivered
  only to the deleted display are now removed with it, rows shared with
  another display survive with the dead one dropped from their delivery chips,
  and the delete dialog counts the two separately.
- **A dashboard bound to the same display twice is listed once (#229).** A
  repeated id in a dashboard's binding listed it twice under that display on
  the Dashboards page, read as "Push to 2 linked displays", and pushed the
  same frame to the same panel twice. Bindings now collapse repeats when a
  dashboard is loaded or saved, so existing dashboards heal on their own.

## [0.302.1], 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Community templates, install and uninstall work again under the Home
  Assistant App.** The merged Browse catalog (0.297.0) prefixed its request
  URLs with the ingress path a second time, because the ones it reads from the
  page already carry it. Home Assistant answered the doubled path with a 404,
  which the page reported as "Template catalog unreachable right now"; install
  and uninstall failed the same way. Requests now go through one idempotent
  prefix helper, and a test pins both halves of the contract.

## [0.302.0], 2026-08-15

### Changed

- **Browse catalog rows lead with the screenshot.** Rows are roomier by
  default: a 300×180 preview instead of 152×95, a larger title, and three lines
  of description rather than two. A **Cozy / Compact** control in the toolbar
  switches back to a scanning density, and the choice is remembered per browser.
- **A row's screenshot enlarges in place.** Clicking a row thumbnail opens the
  full-size preview directly, the same lightbox the detail sheet uses, instead
  of only being reachable by opening the sheet first.

## [0.301.1], 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- **Deleting a device no longer strands the dashboards it shared** (#229).
  A deleted device's id stayed on every dashboard it was bound to alongside
  another device, and the delete flow decided what a device owned by counting
  ids rather than live devices. A dashboard bound to two panels therefore kept
  a dead id after the first was deleted, which made it look permanently shared:
  deleting the second panel never offered to remove it, and no later delete
  could either. Ownership is now judged on devices that still exist, so the last
  real device to go takes the dashboard with it and dashboards already carrying
  a dead id heal on the next delete. Wiping a device now also drops it from
  dashboards it shared, and the Dashboards list counts live bindings, so a row
  can no longer read "unbound" and "Push to 2" at once. Panel view resolves its
  gamut from the first live binding for the same reason.

## [0.301.0], 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Touch controls are drawn in the render unless the panel draws them
  itself** (#228). The button, switch, slider and stepper elements reserved a
  blank rect in every composition, because a touch panel's firmware draws the
  control into that rect itself. On every other target, a display-only panel, a
  preview, a dashboard with no device bound, nothing ever filled it, so a
  control placed in the editor rendered as an invisible hole. The reserve is
  now kept only for panels advertising protocol v2; everywhere else the server
  paints the control. The editor and the renderer share one painter, so the
  preview and the composition can't drift, and `render_report` gained
  `touch_primitives`, naming the bound devices that draw each control
  on-device.

## [0.300.4], 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Companion responses are validated against contract 0.12.** The vendored
  copy of the app contract was several versions behind, so Lineups, the
  session endpoint and the whole Gallery surface were checked against local
  transcriptions of shapes rather than the published ones. The refreshed copy
  carries every value we had been serving ahead of it, so the local errata
  list is now empty, and the Gallery, Lineup, session and capability-support
  fixtures are exercised directly.

## [0.300.3], 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **BMP and GIF images are visible over the Companion API (#117).** The
  Gallery accepts both and the Web UI serves them unchanged, but the client
  contract's media types cover neither, so a folder of pre-dithered BMPs read
  as empty from the phone. Those images are now served as a full-size PNG
  rendition, generated on first request and cached beside the thumbnails. The
  stored file is never rewritten, and the reported filename, size and cache
  validator describe what is actually served.

## [0.300.2], 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **A body that isn't JSON says so.** `/api/v1/device/discover` and
  `/register` fell back to an empty object when the body failed to parse, so
  the rejection blamed the first field they couldn't find (`device_id is
  required`) rather than the parse. A client that formats a Python repr
  (single quotes, bare `None`) instead of serialising JSON now gets `body is
  not valid JSON`. An empty body still names the missing field.

## [0.300.1], 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **A placeholder MAC can no longer claim another device's token (#226).**
  `/discover` matches the announced MAC against registered instances, and it
  took any non-empty string at face value. A client that formatted its own
  null into the body sent `"None"`, so two such clients resolved to one
  instance and the second was handed the first one's access token; an
  all-zero or broadcast MAC from a radio that wasn't up yet did the same.
  `null`, `"None"`, `00:00:00:00:00:00`, `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` and similar
  stand-ins now read as no MAC at all: `/discover` rejects them with `400`,
  `/register` pairs but stores no MAC, and an instance that already carries
  one from an earlier install stops being claimable. No migration; the
  stored value stays where it is and simply stops matching.

## [0.300.0], 2026-08-14

### Added

- **Companion API can browse and add to the photo Gallery (#225).** Six
  routes under `/api/app/v1/gallery/` list folders, create an internal
  folder, read a folder's images, upload one image, and serve a thumbnail or
  the stored content. Folders and images are addressed by opaque server-minted
  ids rather than filenames or host paths, external folders are read-only, and
  `gallery:read` + `gallery:write` ride along with the pairing role.
  Uploads are normalised on the way in: all EXIF is dropped (location
  included), source orientation is baked into the pixels, and the ICC profile
  is preserved. Sending a Gallery photo still goes through the existing
  `POST /images` flow, so there is one send path rather than two.
- **Displays report which protocol capabilities they support.** Each device in
  the Companion API's list carries a `capability_support` map with a
  `supported` / `unsupported` / `unknown` state per capability, computed from
  the display's own heartbeats. A display that has not checked in recently
  enough to tell reads `unknown` rather than being reported as incapable.

### Fixed

- **The offline photo album form no longer offers displays that can't play
  one.** It listed every registered display whose kind resolved, so an album
  could be bound to a panel with no frame cache, save cleanly, and then never
  receive anything. Displays that reported no frame cache are now disabled
  with the reason shown, ones that have not checked in yet are marked as
  unconfirmed but still bindable, and a submitted target that reported no
  frame cache is dropped rather than saved.

## [0.299.0], 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **`/api/v1/device/discover` rejects an announce with no MAC (#226).** The
  claim path matches the firmware's MAC against a registered instance, so a
  MAC-less announce landed in the Discovered strip, registered cleanly, and
  then polled forever on `registered: false` with nothing in the response
  saying why. It now returns `400` naming the missing field and pointing at
  the pairing-code path for clients that have no MAC to report.

### Changed

- **Device cards show the device id and the MAC.** Connection details carry
  both, and a REST device with no stored MAC says so rather than omitting the
  row, so a stuck pairing or a pair of clients announcing the same MAC is
  visible from the card.

## [0.298.0], 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Browse catalog rows carry a larger preview.** The row thumbnail goes from
  104x65 to 152x95 and the description runs to two clamped lines, so a
  screenshot is legible in the list rather than only in the sheet. The sheet's
  own preview grows to 264px and now opens in a lightbox on click, with the
  thumbnail strip choosing which shot opens, arrow keys stepping through an
  entry's screenshots, and Escape closing the lightbox before the sheet.

## [0.297.0], 2026-08-14

### Changed

- **Browse community widgets and Community templates are one Browse catalog
  page.** Widgets, themes and templates now share a single list of dense rows
  with a persistent filter rail (type with live counts, status, category,
  panel fit), a ranked search, a sort menu, and a detail sheet holding the
  long description, the plugin folders and the install detail that used to
  make every card tall. Selecting Templates switches the list into the
  resolution-grouped sections the standalone templates page was built around;
  `/plugins/templates/` redirects into it. Install and uninstall post in
  place, so the list keeps its filters, sort position and scroll, and the
  topbar "Restart required" button lights up as soon as the first change
  lands.

## [0.296.1], 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Release notes cover the whole span a release ships.** Every version bump
  writes its own CHANGELOG section, and the release workflow extracted only
  the section matching the tag, stopping at the next `## [`. A release cut
  after fifty bumps therefore published the last bump's entry and dropped
  everything else, which is what v0.296.0 did on first publish. The workflow
  now reads down to the previous release tag's section, keeping the
  intermediate version headers, and falls back to the single-section
  behaviour when there's no earlier tag to stop at.

## [0.296.0], 2026-08-13

First stable release since 0.259.0. Home Assistant users on the stable add-on
channel should take this one: 0.277.1 fixed the community-template catalog,
the Share dialog, template install and the Home Assistant device picker under
ingress, all of which requested root-relative paths and so left the app for
the host root. Also here since 0.259.0: the Companion API grew Lineups
authoring, read and control with per-client permissions and a session
endpoint; dashboards gained data-change refreshes, placement-level refresh
cadences, and cell options that fill from another option; a GTFS departure
board, three TRMNL pixel fonts and BWRY palette calibration landed; and
CircuitPython clients can declare their panel rotation at registration. The
per-version sections below carry the detail.

### Fixed

- **Switching on the Template marketplace experiment while online features are
  off no longer changes nothing without saying why.** The community-templates
  section on Browse was gated on the experiment *and* the master online
  switch, so an install that enabled the experiment alone saw the page it
  already had, with nothing anywhere to explain the omission. Community
  widgets are served from a static index on GitHub and stay browsable with the
  online switch off, which made the missing templates section read as a bug
  rather than a setting. The section now renders on the experiment alone and,
  when the online switch is off, says the templates come from api.tesserae.ink
  and links straight to the switch. The Settings row for the flag carries the
  same note.

## [0.295.0], 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **A daily or interval Lineup can be played from the Companion API.** Records
  that came from the schedule store carry no display of their own and fire at
  whatever displays their dashboards are bound to, but the action endpoint
  resolved targets from the Lineup's own binding, so `play`, `next` and
  `previous` answered `invalid_target` for every one of them from v0.287.0.
  Targets are now resolved the way the engine resolves them, and the same
  resolved set is reported as `resolved_device_ids` on the projection so a
  client targets and labels from the server's answer rather than deriving it.
  An explicit `device_ids` subset is bounded by the resolved set.
- **Adding an unknown dashboard to a Lineup by `PATCH` is refused.** Creation
  already answered 404 for a dashboard id that doesn't exist; an edit built a
  step pointing at nothing. Only ids being added are checked, so a member
  dashboard deleted since the Lineup was built can still be edited out.

### Added

- **`GET /api/app/v1/session`** returns the token id, the scopes the presented
  credential carries now, and the Settings page where they're granted. An
  optional scope can be granted or withdrawn long after pairing, and the
  pairing response was the only place a client saw its scope list, so it had
  no way to tell an ungranted permission from a granted one until a write
  answered 403. Advertised as the `session_read` capability.

## [0.294.3], 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **An unchanged panel is no longer reported as a failed one.** Playing a
  Lineup step whose frame the panel already shows flashed "Couldn't play step
  N: no_change, one or more panels failed to render/publish". Nothing had
  failed: `no_change` means the rendered frame matched the panel's current
  digest, so the publish was correctly skipped, which on e-ink is the point.
  The multi-panel aggregate attached the render/publish error to every status
  that wasn't `sent`, and the Play button branched on `sent` alone. Fixed in
  both places, plus the Fire now, schedule fire, and onboarding push routes,
  which shared the check.
- **A rotation step no longer re-renders on every tick.** Only `sent` and
  `quiet` recorded a step as fired, so a step whose content was stable never
  recorded itself: each tick inside its dwell re-fired it and paid a full
  render to rediscover the same digest, rather than rendering once per dwell.
  Most visible on a single-step "keep this page fresh" rotation, where every
  tick re-rendered. `no_change` now counts as fired, matching the hold-clearing
  check directly above it.

## [0.294.1], 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **A plugin's admin page no longer answers unauthenticated requests.**
  `/plugins/<id>/` matched the rule that exempts plugin *assets*
  (`/plugins/<id>/client.js`) from the auth gate, because its trailing slash
  left a non-empty first segment, which was all the check tested for. Every
  plugin admin page was therefore reachable without a session from loopback,
  contrary to the comment on the rule, which reserves the exemption for the
  assets the in-process renderer fetches while composing. Both segments must
  now be non-empty; renderer asset fetches are unaffected.

## [0.294.0], 2026-08-12

### Added

- **GTFS / GTFS-RT departure board.** A new `gtfs` widget shows approaching
  vehicles at a stop, from any agency's static GTFS zip plus optional realtime
  feeds: live times, delays against the timetable, cancellations, service
  alerts, and track numbers where the feed publishes them. Presets cover the
  NYC Subway (one per realtime line group) and BART; anything else takes URLs.
  A stop finder at `/plugins/gtfs/` searches a feed for the `stop_id` a cell
  needs and reports which routes call there and what each `direction_id` means
  in headsign terms, which GTFS itself never states. Two stops can share one
  board, merged by time, and a large cell can split into two columns by
  direction. Realtime protobuf is decoded directly, including the NYCT track
  extension, so no protobuf dependency is added.
- **A cell option can be filled and locked by another option, `fill_from`.**
  An option names the option that owns its value plus a value map; the editor
  fills the field from the controlling option's current value and renders it
  read-only, so it stays visible and stays in the POST. Suits presets that
  supply a set of endpoints together, where mixing one preset's value with
  another's is never valid.

### Fixed

- **`choices_from` dropdowns are no longer empty in the widget preview.** The
  preview read the raw manifest, so every dynamically-populated dropdown
  rendered with no choices for every widget that uses one. It now materialises
  options through the same helper the page editor uses.

## [0.293.0], 2026-08-12

### Added

- **Placement-level daily widget refreshes.** Widgets may declare
  `updates.on_schedule` so each Grid cell or Canvas element can independently
  refresh at the server's local day boundary or an explicitly selected time.
  Due refreshes coalesce per dashboard, respect quiet hours, update only
  displays already showing the dashboard, and silently re-warm inactive Lineup
  pages without selecting or advancing them. The feature is off by default.

## [0.292.3], 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **Saving a device no longer drops the MQTT session.** Adding a device,
  saving its card, editing a panel, and applying a calibration profile all
  rebuild the transport, and none of them change how Tesserae reaches the
  broker. Each one disconnected and redialled anyway, leaving a disconnect /
  reconnect cycle in the broker's log that reads as a connection fault while
  you are debugging one, and putting in-flight QoS 1 messages at risk. The
  rebuild now keeps a live session whose resolved broker settings are
  unchanged, and re-registers its callbacks rather than stacking a second set
  per rebuild. A genuine broker change still redials.
- **The log no longer announces a connection the broker refused.** "MQTT
  connected" was written as soon as the socket opened, before the broker had
  answered, and the CONNACK return code was discarded. A rejected login read
  as a successful connect followed by a mysterious disconnect. The line now
  comes from the broker's acceptance and carries the client id; a refusal
  logs an error naming the broker and client id.
- **The MQTT DISCONNECT packet is now actually sent.** Teardown stopped the
  network loop before asking the client to disconnect, so the packet that
  loop was responsible for writing never went out and the broker held the
  session open until keepalive expired.

## [0.292.2], 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Dynamic widget pickers no longer look configured when their saved value is
  empty or unavailable.** Gallery folders, Home Assistant entities, Todo lists,
  and other runtime-backed selects now show the actual unset or removed value
  until it is deliberately replaced, instead of letting the browser display
  and later submit the first available option.
- **A select whose saved value and choices disagree only on type** (a stored
  `"300"` against a numeric `300` choice) now matches that choice instead of
  rendering it twice, once as unavailable.

## [0.292.1], 2026-08-11

### Changed

- **The vendored Companion contract is verbatim again.** Six values Tesserae
  serves ahead of the published contract had been edited straight into the
  copy, which turned refreshing it from a copy into a merge (an overwrite would
  have dropped them silently) and left the deviations as comments only findable
  by whoever read that region. They now live in one `contract_errata.py`, each
  with the version that started serving it and why, layered over the spec at
  load. A test asserts every entry is still missing from the vendored file, so
  the first refresh that includes one fails and names the entry to delete
  rather than letting the list rot.

## [0.292.0], 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Companion API: Lineups authoring** (#206). `POST /api/app/v1/lineups`
  creates one from the same four intents the setup wizard offers, through the
  same builder, so a Lineup made from the app and one made from the web are the
  same record made the same way. `PATCH /lineups/{id}` edits one, gated on the
  `lineups:write` permission an operator grants per client.

  Three refusals carry the design. A Lineup using anything outside the four
  intents is web-only, because a partial write from a client that can't see
  those fields would flatten them. A field the app may not set is rejected
  rather than ignored, so a client can't believe it wrote something it didn't.
  And an edit must present the `ETag` from the copy it read: the web editor is
  very likely the other writer, and a stale write is refused with `412` rather
  than applied. Every field a request doesn't mention keeps its stored value.

  Binding an unassigned dashboard to the Lineup's display is opt-in via
  `bind_unassigned_dashboards`, so a dashboard already on another display is
  never quietly moved.

### Changed

- **A valid credential that lacks a permission now answers `403`, not `401`**
  (#207). 401 tells a client its credential is dead and to pair again, but an
  optional permission is an operator toggle in Settings, so re-pairing lands in
  exactly the same place. A missing or revoked credential is still `401`.

## [0.291.1], 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **A Lineup's "open in Tesserae" link pointed at a page that doesn't exist**
  (#203). The Companion projection spelled the path out as `/decks/{id}`, which
  was never a route: the only GET a deck id has is its editor at
  `/decks/{id}/edit`. Every such link the app advertised since v0.287.0 was a
  404. The URL is resolved from the routing table now, and asserted against it,
  so a future rename fails a test rather than shipping a dead link.

## [0.291.0], 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Lineups read carries everything an advanced Lineup holds** (#203). The
  projection gained the fields a Lineup can use but the four authoring intents
  can't express: entry and home page, home timeout, refresh cadence, end time,
  days of week, priority, smart sync and its lead, mode, minimum hold, the
  time-of-day window, and the fallback dashboard, plus each dashboard's raw
  refresh override, links and conditions. A client that must not edit such a
  record can now describe it completely, which is what stops a partial update
  flattening the parts it never knew about. Which legacy store a record was
  migrated from stays private.

- **Lineup step and play report their own job kind.** `next`, `previous` and
  `play` return `kind: lineup_action` rather than riding on `dashboard_push`, so
  a client's activity view can name explicit Lineup control instead of
  presenting it as an ordinary push. The History source stays `companion`.

## [0.290.0], 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **A compressed RSS feed no longer reports itself as broken XML** (#212).
  urllib doesn't transparently decompress, and a CDN that gzips regardless of
  what was asked for handed the parser a binary blob, which it reported as "not
  well-formed (invalid token): line 1, column 0". That reads like a broken feed
  rather than a compressed one, so the widget blamed the wrong thing. The
  request now asks for no compression and decodes anyway if the server ignores
  that.

  It presented as intermittent because the editor preview falls back to a
  Chromium fetch, which decompresses natively, and its result is cached for ten
  minutes. A dashboard therefore rendered correctly right after anyone opened
  the editor, and showed the error once the cache expired. The same fallback
  explains the `TimeoutError: widget data fetch exceeded the page-render
  budget` on the panel preview: it was firing a whole browser fetch on every
  preview because the plain fetch looked like a failure.

- **The shared plugin HTTP helpers decode compressed responses too.**
  `fetch_text` and `fetch_json` had the same gap, so any widget on a
  CDN-fronted API could receive an undecodable body. The decoder is now one
  implementation in `app.plugin_http`, which `calendar_core` (where this class
  of bug was first fixed, #168) now shares instead of keeping its own copy.

## [0.289.2], 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **A Lineup with the default hold no longer sticks on one dashboard** (#167).
  The minimum-hold guard measured from the moment of the last paint, and a
  paint lands a few seconds into its window (the tick that noticed the
  boundary), so the next boundary fell just inside the hold whenever the hold
  equalled the dwell. `advance_min_hold_minutes` defaults to 5, so a five
  minute cycle, the obvious thing to build, swallowed every other window; with
  two dashboards the swallowed window is always the same one, and the panel sat
  on a single dashboard indefinitely while still firing on the grid at twice
  the interval. The hold is now measured window to window for a scheduled
  advance, so a hold equal to the dwell swallows nothing while a hold longer
  than the dwell still slows the cycle as intended. A condition changing the
  step inside one window is unchanged, still held from the last paint.

## [0.289.1], 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **Panel dimension fields are labelled "Logical panel width / height"**, with a
  line under them saying they're the composition orientation dashboards render
  at, not the physical size the device reports. The old label read as the
  hardware's own dimensions, which is exactly what they aren't on any device
  whose mounted orientation differs from its framebuffer: a CircuitPython board
  with a built-in display assumes a standard orientation, and the operator may
  want another. Renamed across the device card, add-device, onboarding, the
  app-level panel block, and the relay pairing form, along with the matching
  validation messages, so the wording can't drift between them.

## [0.289.0], 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **One write path for creating a Lineup** (#204). The setup wizard's four
  buttons posted to three different routes backed by three different stores, so
  what a record ended up being depended on which button made it. All four now
  post the same shape to one create, which maps the authoring intent onto the
  unified model. The scheduler already ran decks natively, so nothing about how
  a Lineup fires changes; the per-store forms behind the Rotations and
  Schedules pages are untouched, and existing records are unaffected.

  A dashboard picked in the wizard that isn't on any display yet now binds to
  the Lineup's display for every intent, which the cycle and by-hand paths
  already did. Without it a freshly-created Lineup can have steps that never
  render.

  This is what native authoring in the companion app was waiting on (#206):
  there is now somewhere for `POST /lineups` to land.

## [0.288.0], 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Per-client permissions for the companion app** (#207). Settings → Companion
  lists what each paired app can do and offers the abilities that shouldn't
  arrive by default. Today that's creating and editing Lineups: granting it is
  a decision per client, takes effect on the next request, and can be withdrawn
  the same way, all without the user re-pairing since the token doesn't change.

### Fixed

- **A gallery preview no longer eats a photo** (#209). The sequential cursor
  advanced on every render, and opening the dashboard editor, hovering a card
  on the dashboards list, and probing the widget are all renders. Each one
  consumed an image the panel then skipped. Only a render headed for a panel
  moves the album on now; a preview shows the photo the panel will paint next.
- **A stored permission the server doesn't recognise is dropped on load**
  rather than kept. A scope check is a membership test, so a typo sat in the
  credential file looking like a grant while granting nothing.

## [0.287.0], 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Companion API: Lineups read + control** (#205). `GET /api/app/v1/lineups`
  and `/lineups/{id}` report each Lineup with its dashboards, which display is
  on which page, and whether the app may edit it;
  `POST /lineups/{id}/actions` enables, disables, steps a display forward or
  back, or plays a chosen dashboard. Steps read each display's own position, so
  two panels on one Lineup move independently rather than being pulled to a
  shared index. Repaints go through the existing job pipeline with an
  `Idempotency-Key`; enable and disable answer immediately, since they touch no
  panel.

  Editability is decided by the server, not the client: a Lineup using
  conditions, a fallback dashboard, priority mode, smart sync, day or
  time-of-day windows, or a home card reports `native_editable: false` with the
  reason, and stays fully readable and controllable. That keeps a partial
  client update from flattening fields it never knew about. Authoring itself
  waits on #204.

  Pairing now grants `lineups:read` and `lineups:control`. Authoring
  (`lineups:write`) deliberately does not ride along, see #207.

### Fixed

- **The client protocol no longer claims re-registering changes a declared
  rotation** (#208). It doesn't: `/register` for an existing device id, and
  `/discover` matching a known MAC, both return the existing device without
  rebuilding its panel. The Rotation dropdown owns the value after the instance
  exists, and the page now says so.

## [0.286.2], 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **A device's Rotation control reads in the client's own terms** (#200). The
  dropdown labelled its degrees relative to landscape, so a client declaring a
  720x1280 framebuffer at `rotation: 0` (paint my buffer as-is) read back as
  90°, and correcting it to 0° transposed the dimensions, which then derived
  90° again on the next save. The degrees are now the turn from the panel's own
  framebuffer, so the card agrees with what the client declared. Panels whose
  framebuffer is landscape, or that never declared one, are unaffected.

### Changed

- **A deck advance that can't paint says so** (#167). When a page failed to
  push, the advance was skipped silently and the panel kept showing the
  previous page, so a dashboard that consistently fails to render looks like a
  deck skipping it rather than a page that won't paint. The failure now records
  a deck event and a log line naming the page and the error.

## [0.286.1], 2026-08-10

### Changed

- **A catalog entry's own mark now replaces its card screenshot**, rather than
  only standing in where no screenshot exists. A widget that renders whatever
  the user's own library holds screenshots as one arbitrary photo, which says
  nothing about what the widget is; the service's logo is the thing people scan
  the grid for. Entries without a mark are unchanged.

## [0.286.0], 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Catalog entries can carry their own icon.** A widget fronting a service with
  a recognisable mark (Immich, a photo host, a transit agency) can ship that
  mark in the catalog and have the Browse card render it in place of a Phosphor
  glyph, which no glyph set can match for recognisability. The entry names a
  bare filename resolved under the catalog's `icons/` directory, never a URL, so
  a catalog can't aim every Browse page's `<img>` at a host of its choosing; an
  invalid value falls back to the glyph rather than failing the catalog parse.
  The glyph stays the fallback for an install that can't reach the catalog, or
  an image that fails to load.

## [0.285.0], 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Clear a duplicate widget from the Widgets page.** Plugins load from three
  roots (bundled, then `data/authored/`, then `data/marketplace/`) and the first
  to claim an id wins, so a widget pushed from Studio shadows a marketplace
  install of the same id and the loser sits on disk erroring forever. The Loader
  errors card now names the copy that is actually in use and offers to delete the
  shadowed one, which previously needed shell access. The registry re-scans in
  place, so no restart. Bundled copies are never removable, and a folder that is
  one of several in a catalog bundle points at Browse instead of being removed on
  its own.

## [0.284.0], 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Any update cadence for a dashboard.** The Updates control gains a 30 minute
  preset and a **custom…** option with a minutes box, so a dashboard can be set
  to any interval up to a day. Matching a battery panel's own wake interval
  matters: a panel sleeping 30 minutes against a dashboard refreshing every 15
  only ever downloads the newest render, so a sequential gallery appears to skip
  every second picture.

### Fixed

- **A cadence outside the preset list renders as itself.** `refresh_minutes`
  always accepted anything up to a day, but a value the dropdown didn't offer
  had no matching option and the list drew it as "only when pushed", so opening
  the dropdown and picking anything silently rewrote it.
- **All-day events no longer disappear from calendar_day/week/month/schedule
  in the evening.** Every calendar widget's shared event-fetching layer
  compared an all-day event's date against the requested time window as if
  both were full timestamps; once the UTC calendar day rolled past local
  midnight — any evening in a timezone behind UTC, such as US timezones —
  today's all-day events silently dropped out of the response.
- **calendar_day's all-day events span the full width of the event column.**
  They were laid out in a wrapping flex row, so each pill was only as wide as
  its own title and stopped short of the column's right edge, reading as a
  small tag instead of a bar covering the day it applies to.

## [0.283.0], 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Clients can declare their panel rotation at registration** (#200). `rotation`
  (0 / 90 / 180 / 270) is now accepted on `/api/v1/device/discover` and
  `/api/v1/device/register`. Sending it means `panel_w` / `panel_h` describe the
  client's framebuffer and the rotation is the turn from that buffer to the
  dashboard canvas, so a panel that autodetects as 1200x1920 can drive a
  1920x1200 dashboard and still receive a 1200x1920 image. The buffer is stored
  as the panel's native dims and echoed back as `native_w` / `native_h` in the
  `/frame` envelope. Omitting the field keeps the previous reading, where the
  reported dims are the canvas itself.
- **The CircuitPython renderers rotate onto a declared framebuffer.**
  `circuitpython_png` and `circuitpython_bmp` emitted at composition dims, which
  left a rotated dashboard un-paintable on a client whose buffer is fixed the
  other way. They now turn the composition onto the buffer before quantising,
  the way the `.bin` renderers do. Only devices that declared a buffer are
  affected; where the native dims were inferred from the preset table, output
  keeps its existing shape.

### Fixed

- **A portrait client self-registering over REST no longer lands inconsistent.**
  The orientation fix in v0.280.0 covered the admin Register button but not
  `/api/v1/device/register` or the setup wizard's one-click register, so devices
  paired through those paths still stored portrait dims against a landscape
  orientation and had them swapped on the next save (#200).

## [0.282.0], 2026-08-09

### Added

- **Palette calibration for 4-colour BWRY panels** (#201). `bwry_4` was the one
  supported gamut with no palette-profile family, so the Calibration tab hid
  itself on a PicPak and frames were always dithered against ideal sRGB
  primaries the ink cannot reach: its yellow is a dark mustard, so error
  diffusion spent yellow on highlights the panel never delivers. The gamut now
  has a measured palette and two presets, **Nominal BWRY** (the default, which
  renders identically to no profile, so nothing restyles itself) and **PicPak
  Calibrated**. The palette editor drops the blue and green swatches for these
  panels, and the palette-swatch test pattern stops painting two inks a BWRY
  panel doesn't have. Calibration measured on a physical PicPak 4.2" panel by
  [varanu5](https://github.com/varanu5); see NOTICES.md.
- Switching on a PicPak's **Calibrated palette + tone mapping** toggle now
  applies the measured palette. The toggle has been offered on these panels all
  along and quietly did nothing, since there was no BWRY calibration data to
  apply. It stays off by default.

## [0.281.0], 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **A dashboard preview is never served from a cache.** Compositions went out
  with no cache directives at all, which leaves an intermediary free to cache
  them heuristically. Behind a caching reverse proxy the editor's preview could
  therefore be a composition rendered by an older Tesserae, so anything the
  template had gained since (the drag-to-swap overlay) simply wasn't there, with
  nothing in the browser console to explain it. Compositions now go out
  `no-store`, and the editor's preview frame is version-stamped so an upgrade
  can't reuse a copy cached from the version before it.
- **Dragging a widget on the preview works with a finger.** The drag surface had
  no `touch-action`, so on a touchscreen the browser claimed the gesture for
  scrolling and no drag ever started.

## [0.280.0], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **A portrait panel's width and height stay where you put them** (#200). A
  client reports its panel dimensions but never an orientation, so a display
  taller than it is wide was stored with portrait dimensions and its device
  kind's landscape orientation. Nothing read the contradiction until the next
  save of that card, which resolved it by rewriting the dimensions to match the
  orientation: 1200×1920 became 1920×1200 after editing something unrelated like
  the sleep interval, and typing the dimensions back swapped them again. The
  orientation is now derived from the reported dimensions at registration, and a
  save prefers whichever of the two the user actually changed, so a stored
  mismatch is repaired on the orientation side instead. Moving the rotation
  dropdown still drives the dimensions as before, and the 180° half of a
  rotation is preserved either way.
- **Deleting a device with the wipe option no longer leaves its last frame
  behind** (#199). The wipe cleared dashboards, history, per-device settings and
  the calibration image, but not the pointer to the frame most recently rendered
  for that device. Renders are content-addressed, so the artifact was still on
  disk too: registering the same device id again was handed the dashboard from
  before the wipe rather than the 204 that means "nothing here yet". The wipe now
  drops that pointer along with any pre-warmed deck or album frames for the
  device.

## [0.279.1], 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **Rearrange widgets by dragging them on the live preview.** Swapping cells
  shipped in 0.279.0 as a drag handle on the editor's form cards, which is not
  where anyone looks to move something around a dashboard. The preview itself is
  now the drag surface: press a cell, a label follows the pointer, the cell
  underneath outlines, and releasing swaps the two widgets. The card handles
  remain as a second route in for narrow screens where the preview is scaled
  well down. None of this reaches a device render, it lives in the preview-only
  overlay.

## [0.279.0], 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Drag a cell onto another to swap the two widgets** (discussion #198).
  Grid cells carry absolute geometry, so a widget was welded to whatever box it
  was first assigned to: rearranging a dashboard meant re-picking every widget
  and re-entering its settings. Each cell card now has a drag handle in its
  header; drop it on another card and the two widgets trade places, settings
  and touch actions included, while both boxes stay exactly where they are. The
  auto-managed status bar is pinned and doesn't take part.

### Fixed

- **Switching to a layout with fewer cells warns before dropping widgets.**
  Applying a smaller preset pairs each of its slots with a cell in order and
  discards the surplus, taking their settings with them. The editor markup had
  carried a flag for this warning since the feature shipped, with nothing
  reading it, so the confirmation never appeared. It now names the widgets that
  won't fit before anything is written.

## [0.278.2], 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **Click a canvas dashboard's name to rename it.** Rename already existed
  behind the pencil in the switcher menu, but that menu is where you go to open
  a *different* dashboard, so the name in the toolbar is what people reach for
  first. It now opens the same rename prompt.

## [0.278.1], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Renders started from the UI show the dashboard, not the setup page, under
  Home Assistant.** Inside HA's Ingress tab every in-app URL carries HA's
  `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>` prefix, and any render the browser asked for
  passed that prefix through to the headless renderer. The renderer fetches
  over loopback, which skips HA's proxy, so Tesserae saw the prefix as part of
  the path: it matched no route, the loopback bypass that lets the renderer
  read `/compose/` never applied, and what got screenshotted was the password
  setup screen. A canvas Send, the panel preview, the render report, the touch
  monitor and the template share preview were all affected; scheduled and
  device-driven pushes were not, since they build their URLs from `base_url`
  rather than the request. Templates already submitted with a setup-screen
  preview need resubmitting from an updated install.

## [0.278.0], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **A rotation advances on the anchor grid the card predicts** (#167). The
  minimum-hold guard, which exists to stop a flapping condition flipping a
  panel back and forth, was also gating advances that the clock had triggered,
  and a held advance then fired the instant the hold lapsed. That off-grid fire
  became the reference for the next hold, so with the default 5-minute hold and
  a 5-minute dwell a single off-grid advance (a restart, an enable, a manual
  play) re-paced the rotation permanently: it kept the right interval but ran
  minutes behind the times the Lineups card showed under "next advance", and it
  never recovered. A clock-driven advance is now held against the dwell
  window's start rather than the moment of the last push, so a held advance
  resumes on a later boundary and the rotation stays in phase with its anchor.
  A condition changing the step inside one window is still held from the last
  push, so an urgent step takes over as soon as the hold lapses.

## [0.277.1], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Sharing a community template works under Home Assistant ingress.** The
  Share dialog, the community-templates catalog, and template install all
  requested root-relative paths, so under ingress (or any reverse proxy on a
  subpath) they left the app and hit the host root instead. The reply was never
  JSON, and Share reported "Couldn't prepare the share dialog; is the server
  reachable?" on a perfectly reachable server. All of these URLs now carry the
  script root, as the rest of the UI already did.
- **Share failures say what went wrong.** A non-JSON reply is now reported with
  its status code, and a redirect to the login page is named as a likely
  expired session, instead of both being labelled as an unreachable server.
- The Home Assistant device picker in Settings also requested an unprefixed
  path, so its device list stayed empty under ingress.

## [0.277.0], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Toggling a dashboard's status bar keeps you in the editor** (#197). The
  switch posts a native form (it restructures the layout, so the page has to
  reload), and the redirect afterwards followed the `Referer` header. Behind a
  proxy that strips it, Home Assistant's ingress among them, there was nothing
  to follow and the browser landed on the dashboard list: the toggle had saved,
  but the editing session looked thrown away. Every editor save route now
  redirects to the dashboard it just changed.
- **The history widget shows the Title you gave it** (#196). A single-entity
  card printed the entity's friendly name in the heading and ignored the cell's
  Title option; the option worked only when the card listed several entities. A
  blank Title still falls back to the entity name.
- **The history chart's x-axis carries times instead of sample numbers**
  (#196). The axis was labelled with the ordinal of each plotted point (1, 10,
  19, 26, …), which reads as data but says nothing about when a reading was
  taken. It now labels in the app's timezone at a resolution the window can
  carry: clock time within a day, weekday plus clock time up to three days, and
  the date beyond that. Labels are spaced to the width available, so a wide date
  label thins the axis rather than colliding.

## [0.276.0], 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **A canvas code element no longer picks up an icon stylesheet it never
  referenced.** The sandbox inlines a vendored library when the element's own
  html/css/js mentions it, and the Phosphor regular-weight test matched any bare
  `ph` token, so a custom property named `--ph` pulled the whole icon font in.
  The match now requires the class pair the stylesheet actually defines
  (`class="ph ph-heart"`), and custom-property names are excluded from library
  matching altogether.
- **Injected library CSS can no longer consume an element's first authored
  rule.** The vendored bundles were joined with a `;` separator, which is right
  for JavaScript and a parse error at the top level of a stylesheet, and the
  result was prepended to the element's own CSS inside a single `<style>`. The
  stray token swallowed whichever rule followed, which was always the element's
  first: typically a `:root` block, so every variable it declared resolved to
  empty while the rest of the sheet applied normally. Injected CSS now carries
  no separator and renders in its own `<style>` block, so a malformed injection
  stops at its own stylesheet.

### Added

- **`render_report` names the libraries a code element was given.**
  `injected_libs` rides along without `debug=1` and lists what each sandbox
  inlined, each entry carrying `inferred` and the `matched` token behind the
  choice, so a stylesheet nobody asked for is visible in the report.
- **`autolibs: false` on a code element.** Opts out of auto-injection entirely,
  vendored libraries and bundled fonts alike, for an element that hand-authors
  its own markup and wants no ambient styling.
- **`?debug=1` diagnostics cover the composed stylesheet.** Each code sandbox
  self-reports any rule missing from the sheet it actually parsed, tagged
  `authored` or `library`, so a dropped rule is named instead of pixel-hunted.

## [0.275.0], 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Three pixel fonts: TRMNL12, TRMNL16 and TRMNL21.** Core fonts
  (`fonts_core` 0.6.0) gains a three-family pixel set drawn by Heavyweight
  Digital Type Foundry, Regular and Bold in each, bringing the bundled set to
  39 families. Each family is drawn on a pixel grid at its named height, so set
  it at 12px, 16px or 21px, or an integer multiple, to keep the strokes on
  whole pixels; off-grid sizes resample and soften, which shows up badly once a
  panel quantises to 1-bit. Available anywhere the other bundled fonts are,
  including by family name inside a code element. Vendored as woff2 under the
  SIL Open Font License 1.1, with the licence text alongside each family in
  `plugins/fonts_core/static/`.

## [0.274.2], 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **The top navigation highlights the section you're in on every settings
  page.** Firmware, Cloud relay and the new Companion app page aren't
  `settings_area` routes, and the nav matched an explicit list of endpoints,
  so on those three pages nothing was highlighted at all: the current section
  rendered in ordinary body text rather than the accent. The nav now matches
  the settings area by path, so a page added later can't drop out of it.

## [0.274.1], 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **"Return home after" is offered only for lineups that wait for a person.**
  An auto-advancing lineup reclaims its own panel at the next boundary, so a
  return-home timeout shorter than the advance interval parked the panel on
  the home page in between, which reads as the lineup having stopped cycling.
  The control is now hidden, and disabled so nothing stale is submitted, when
  the advance mode is Timer or Both. Existing lineups keep their stored value
  until the next save through the editor.

## [0.274.0], 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **A lineup set to advance automatically no longer reverts to "By hand".**
  Two separate faults produced that symptom. The management and graph forms
  rebuilt the deck from only their own fields, so any save through them reset
  every advance setting to its default, turning a timer or both deck back into
  a manual one on disk. Those forms now overlay onto the stored deck, which
  also means a field added later can't be silently dropped. Separately, the
  Lineups card for a navigable deck was hardcoded to the "By hand" badge, so
  even a correctly-saved both deck advertised itself as manual; it now shows
  the cadence it runs on. Re-saving an interval or daily lineup through the
  deck editor also no longer converts it to a cycle.
- **Widget copy points at Settings → Widgets.** Error messages and help text
  across the Home Assistant widgets, the gallery, the marketplace setting and
  a touch hint still directed people to a "Plugins" section, which was renamed
  to Widgets.
- **A blocked RSS feed explains itself.** A feed answering with a challenge or
  error page surfaced the raw parser complaint ("not well-formed (invalid
  token): line 1, column 0"), and a block page that happened to be valid XML
  slipped through to render as an empty widget. Both now report that the feed
  returned a web page rather than XML.

## [0.273.0], 2026-08-07

### Added

- **RSS headlines can show an article preview** (discussion #194). A new
  Article preview option on the RSS widget prints one to three lines of each
  item's summary under its headline; off by default, so existing dashboards
  are unchanged. The summary comes from the feed itself (`description` on
  RSS, `summary` falling back to `content` on Atom), so no extra requests are
  made and no article pages are fetched. Markup is stripped and entities
  decoded server-side, the text is capped so a full-text feed can't ship
  whole articles into every render, and a feed whose description is a link
  dump rather than prose shows no excerpt instead of a row of bare URLs.

## [0.272.2], 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **The Lineups editor's Save button is reachable on a phone** (#192). The
  sticky action bar laid its status text and buttons out in a single
  non-wrapping row, so on a narrow screen the buttons were pushed past the
  right edge and Save could not be tapped at all; the longer the deck's page
  chain, the further out they went. The bar now wraps, and the status gives
  up space before the buttons do. Desktop layout is unchanged.

## [0.272.0], 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **Lineups screen cards show the frame the panel was actually sent.** The
  cards re-rendered the dashboard instead of reading what had been pushed, so
  a dashboard whose output moves on its own (a fractal, a clock) showed
  something the panel had never displayed. They now serve the pushed
  composition, the same source the History page reads, falling back to a
  render only for a dashboard that has never been pushed. A dashboard edited
  since its last push keeps showing the old frame, which is what its screen
  is still displaying.
- **Preview thumbnails render in the configured timezone.** The preview
  renderer runs off the request thread and never received the timezone a push
  sets, so Chromium fell back to the container clock and clock widgets in a
  thumbnail rendered in UTC. The zone is now resolved on the request thread
  and passed through, covering the dashboards list, Lineups, the panel-view
  preview and the Companion app's dashboard preview.

## [0.271.0], 2026-08-06

### Added

- **`seeed_reterminal_e1001_gray_legacy` hardware kind.** The reTerminal
  E1001 ships with two glass variants: one carries a built-in 4-gray
  waveform, the other needs register LUTs uploaded instead. They need
  different firmware images but are identical on the wire, down to the
  96000-byte frame, so the new kind exists purely to give the second image
  its own identity and OTA lineage. Rendering is unchanged.
- **`auto_select` on hardware manifests.** A SKU can opt out of being
  inferred from a device's self-report. Relay pairing resolves the most
  specific catalog kind from the reported protocol + gamut, which is
  ambiguous between the two E1001 grayscale variants because their reports
  are identical; the legacy variant now sits out that resolution, so an
  ambiguous report deterministically pairs as
  `seeed_reterminal_e1001_gray`. The variant is only ever set by the
  operator, or by the firmware declaring it at register / discover.

## [0.270.0], 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Settings → Companion app is its own page** (#186). Issuing pairing codes,
  watching pending codes, and disconnecting paired clients moved out of the
  Devices page onto a dedicated tab, so the app surface has room to grow
  without crowding the device list. The page also links the public TestFlight
  beta, with a QR beside it so a phone can install without typing the URL.
  The admin routes moved with it, from `/settings/devices/companion/*` to
  `/settings/companion/*`.

## [0.269.0], 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **The Webpage widget no longer crops direct image URLs.** A URL that
  resolves to an image (PNG, GIF, JPEG, WebP, SVG) is now drawn as an image
  and framed to the cell, so a chart taller than its cell keeps its bottom
  edge instead of being clipped by the embedded viewport. Pages are
  unaffected and still render through the iframe. A new Image fit option
  offers the same five modes as the Send tab (fit, fill, stretch, center,
  center with a blurred background); Scale continues to apply to pages.

## [0.267.0], 2026-08-05

### Added

- **`/discover` announces can suggest a display name** (discussion #24).
  The Register card in Settings → Devices gains a Display name field
  prefilled from the announce's optional `name`; the admin can edit or
  clear it before registering, and later announces never rename an
  already-registered device. The client protocol doc now spells out the
  attribute's behaviour on both `/discover` and `/register`.

### Added

- **Configurable text sizing for calendar_day, calendar_week, and
  calendar_month.** Per-text-type scale sliders (title, header, axis
  label, event title/location/time, 0.01–10.0×), a `date_label_style`
  choice with a full-word option, and a `show_location` toggle for
  the widgets that lacked one. calendar_day also gets configurable
  `day_start_hour`/`day_end_hour` and a `show_density` toggle;
  calendar_week gets a `range_mode` option so its 7-day window can
  either stay anchored to the chosen week-start day or roll from
  today (`rolling_7`), and correctly labels/shades each day by its
  actual weekday rather than its column position in either mode.

### Fixed

- **Multi-day events now display correctly in calendar_day and
  calendar_week.** A multi-day all-day event (e.g. a 3-day conference)
  previously appeared only on its first day, or as a separately-labeled
  pill repeated on each day instead of one bar spanning them. A
  multi-day *timed* event (an overnight block, a multi-day trip) is a
  more common case and had it worse: it vanished entirely after its
  first day, could render at the wrong time or run past midnight on
  later days, and could overflow the visible timetable when
  `day_start_hour`/`day_end_hour` narrowed it. All-day pills in both
  widgets could also draw shifted left of their true day column. Every
  day an event covers now renders correctly clamped to that day.
- **Personal-data snapshots are isolated per paired Companion installation.**
  Independently identified household phones can publish Apple Reminders
  without replacing each other, each phone sees only its own sync status, and
  disabling sync deletes only the publication associated with its pairing.
  Existing single-publisher data remains readable and is replaced by the first
  authenticated publisher that next syncs that source.

## [0.266.0], 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Play and Fire-now push through a button/touch hold.** Clicking a
  step used to fail with a bare "quiet" message when every panel bound
  to the page was still inside a manual page-away hold, even with
  quiet hours disabled. Explicit clicks now fire anyway and clear the
  holds on the pushed panels (so the rejoin pass doesn't later yank
  them off the page), while the timer-driven skip is reported as
  `held` with the reason "all devices manually held" in the flash,
  status pill, and events log.

## [0.265.1], 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Hardware verification records caught up with the bench.** The
  reTerminal E1001 (mono and 4-level grayscale), XIAO 13.3" ePaper
  EE02, TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY Kit, both Inky Impression 4" variants, the
  Waveshare 13.3" Spectra 6, and the 7.3" PhotoPainter are now
  recorded as confirmed on real hardware in their SKU manifests, the
  test matrix, the README tables, and the quickstart banners. The
  docs landing page counts thirteen confirmed panels (plus the
  community-confirmed PicPak) and the architecture doc's stale
  "58 widgets" claim is corrected to the actual 35.

## [0.265.0], 2026-08-05

### Added

- **The setup wizard scopes rotations and decks to a display** (#167
  feedback). The multi-pick steps gain a Display select; only
  dashboards bound to that display (or not yet on any display) are
  offered, the created rotation or deck is bound to it, and picked
  dashboards without a display adopt it, so the whole set plays on one
  panel. Rotations created through `/rotations/new` accept
  `device_ids` accordingly.
- **Lineups warns about delivery gaps.** A card whose dashboards are
  bound to different displays (so no single panel plays the set), or
  that is bound to a display some member dashboard can't render on,
  now says so on the row instead of failing silently.

### Fixed

- **The Lineups page updates itself.** Playing badges, current step,
  next-advance times, group headers and thumbnails now refresh when
  the scheduler fires (via the events stream) and on a slow fallback
  poll; previously everything was frozen at page load.
- **Screen-card thumbnails no longer freeze at their first render.**
  Preview images opt into a freshness window (`?refresh=<s>` on
  `/compose/<id>/preview.png`): a stale cached image is served
  immediately while a re-render is queued behind it, so dashboards
  whose data moves (clocks, feeds) catch up. Thumbnails that aren't
  rendered yet also retry with backoff instead of staying blank.

## [0.264.1], 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Hardware claims reconciled with the bench matrix.** The README's
  supported-hardware tables now use ✅ only for panels confirmed on real
  hardware (the reTerminal E1001, both XIAO panels, and the TRMNL rows
  move to TBD pending hardware reports), gain an Xteink X-series
  section, and correct the Inky Impression 4" variants (600×400
  Spectra 6 vs the legacy 640×400 7-colour ACeP). The reTerminal
  E1002/E1003/E1004 manifests and the test matrix now record their
  real-hardware confirmations, the E1003 including GT911 touch.
- **The widget gallery shows real stability tiers again.** The gallery
  generator reads tiers from `docs/widgets/tiers.md`; it was still
  parsing a README section that moved there, so most cards rendered
  "Tier: -".
- **`app/online.py`'s docstring matches the code again**: online
  features are opt-in and off by default (the stale docstring said the
  opposite; the behaviour never changed).

## [0.264.0], 2026-08-05

### Added

- **Pages can refresh when their data actually changes** (#188).
  Accepted semantic data changes are quietly debounced for 10 seconds,
  then active pages with the policy enabled refresh through the
  existing quiet-hours-aware push path while inactive Deck pages are
  re-warmed without being promoted. TTL-only republishes do not
  refresh, and personal-data PUT/DELETE responses remain independent
  from background render or delivery outcomes.

### Changed

- **Smart sync is a top-level switch on the deck card**, and the deck
  editor's timing and conditions moved into a tuning card. Deck
  conditions also surface on Lineups rows and in the setup wizard.

### Docs

- **Xteink X3 confirmed on real hardware** (#187).

## [0.260.0], 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Widgets can declare opt-in data-change updates** (#185). A widget
  manifest may expose strict `updates.on_change` source declarations,
  optionally narrowed by a declared `selector_option`. Grid cells and
  Canvas widget elements persist an independent `update_on_change`
  policy (off by default), and their editors surface the switch only
  for capable widgets.

## [0.259.0], 2026-08-04

### Changed

- **Decks are now Lineups** (#167). The page is renamed and regrouped
  per display: each display with something lined up gets its own section
  with a live-status header, the device's configured icon, and device
  chips on every row; displays with nothing lined up don't appear. Kind
  labels are now Rotation and Schedule, enable and delete sit behind an
  overflow menu, and the standalone new-deck, new-timed-send and
  new-timer-cycle buttons are gone: the setup wizard, with deck
  suggestions folded in as its intro screen, is the sole entry point.
  The stored records, MCP tools, and REST envelope are unchanged.

### Changed

- **The display setup wizard is a three-step flow.** Behaviour, then
  details (or pages), then a plain-language review, then a created
  screen. It submits through the existing create endpoints in the
  background so it can stay on the created screen, and the deck path
  hands off to the deck editor with the new id. Step blocks now hide
  properly per behaviour (previously every behaviour showed all of
  step 2's fields).

### Added

- **4-level grayscale on the Xteink X3.** A new `xteink_x3_gray` device
  kind matches CrossInk's default grayscale build: the same panel block
  as `xteink_x3` with the renderer overridden to the 2-bpp
  `esp32_gray2_bin` frame (gray_4 gamut), so an X3 running that build
  resolves and pairs. Marked unverified until a frame renders on real
  hardware.

### Changed

- **The Decks page got its designed look.** Implemented from a design
  handoff: a dark on-air bar summarising what's live right now, filter
  tabs, and one row per deck whose body shows the actual dashboards as
  thumbnail screen cards (live previews from the composer). Timer cycles
  show their step chain with the current step lit and the next-advance
  time; timed sends carry their own 24-hour rail with fire marks and a
  ticking now line (replacing the separate Next 24 hours panel); by-hand
  decks get manual stepper buttons that move the display back or forward
  a dashboard. A subtle one-shot flash marks a fresh push, with reduced
  motion respected.

### Changed

- **One editor for every deck** (#167). The separate timer-cycle form is
  gone: cycle cards' Edit, the New timer cycle button (which preselects
  timer advance), and old `/rotations?edit=` links all open the deck
  editor, which gains a Page-conditions fold (author per-page conditions
  with the usual picker; bad JSON is rejected with a message, and saves
  that omit the fields preserve what's stored) and a smart-sync render
  lead input. The wizard's cycle path creates directly and fine-tuning
  happens in the editor afterwards.

### Changed

- **Rotations and schedules are decommissioned as separate concepts**
  (#167). A rotation is now stored and edited as a plain timer deck on the
  cycle trigger; a schedule is a one-page timer deck on the interval or
  daily trigger. The Decks page sections are relabeled Timer cycles and
  Timed sends and show every timer deck regardless of how it was created;
  deck cards show the navigable (manual and both) decks. Everything keeps
  working: the old forms, MCP tools, and REST envelope operate on the same
  records as views, bound cycles advance panel-by-panel with pre-warmed
  frames and manual-hold respect, unbound cycles keep page-binding
  fall-through delivery, and bound timed sends target their own panels.

### Added

- **The wizard now creates, not just prefills.** Its final step shows a
  plain-language review and a Create button that submits through the
  normal endpoints, then lands on the deck list with the new card
  highlighted; Advanced options still opens the full prefilled form. The
  cycle path also gained per-dashboard display times: one minutes input
  per picked dashboard instead of a single shared value (the full cycle
  form always had per-step dwell; the wizard now matches).

- **One card for every deck.** The Decks page now renders every shape (by
  hand, timer cycle, timed send) as the same card: a teal status pane with
  a live progress bar (through the current dwell, until the next fire, or
  toward home return), the kind as a chip, a one-sentence summary, and a
  uniform action row (Send now, Play step, Edit, Enable/Disable, Delete).
  Filter chips narrow the list by kind; the three separate listings are
  gone. Editing expands the matching form inline via the card's Edit.

- **A "Help me choose" wizard on the Decks page.** A guided stepper asks
  one question per screen (what the display should do, which dashboard or
  dashboards, the time or cadence, and a name), teaches what each answer
  creates, and lands on the matching form with everything filled in so the
  last step is just pressing Create. It composes the existing forms;
  nothing new to submit through.

- **The Decks page reads as one list.** The Timed sends and Timer cycles
  headings are gone: timer decks flow directly below the navigable deck
  cards, with a single actions row up top (Help me choose, New deck, New
  timed send, New timer cycle). Copy now leads with button press, the most
  common navigation input, ahead of tap and swipe.

- **Companion API: devices now carry their icon** (#184). `GET
  /api/app/v1/devices` returns each device's resolved Phosphor slug (the
  same identity the device pickers and Settings cards use), so native
  clients can render Display cards with the configured device icon. The
  field is always present; kind defaults apply until the user overrides
  per instance.

- **Physical buttons now work on timer decks** (#167). `rotate_next`,
  `rotate_prev`, and `step:<n>` act on the device's bound timed deck when
  no rotation targets it, with the same manual-hold behaviour rotations
  have; the hold lasts until the deck's next dwell boundary. A `both`-mode
  deck now responds to rotate presses that don't match a page link
  (previously a silent no-op), and the `/frame` rotation envelope reports
  the deck's position so firmware stays informed. When several timed decks
  are bound, the highest `advance_priority` wins.

- **Timer decks can now fire on schedule-style triggers** (#167). Besides the
  classic anchor cycle, a deck's timer advance supports an `interval` trigger
  (cooldown floor since the last fire, optional wrap-around time-of-day
  window) and a `daily` trigger (once per local day at a set time, with the
  backfill guard), plus a whole-deck fallback page for when every page's
  conditions fail. A deck with no bound devices fires to the page's own
  devices. These are the shapes the upcoming schedule/rotation migration
  maps onto; existing decks are unchanged (`cycle` is the default).

### Changed

- **One Decks page for everything a display shows over time** (#167). The
  Schedules and Rotations pages fold into the Decks page as sections, with
  their forms, timeline, status pills, and every action intact; the old
  URLs and in-app links redirect to the right section, deep edit links
  included. The top nav has a single Decks entry. The MCP
  rotation/schedule tools keep working as compatibility adapters and are
  marked deprecated in the agent docs; `create_deck` now documents the
  timer and schedule-style triggers as the preferred path.

- **Schedules and rotations now live in the deck store** (#167). On first
  start after updating, `rotations.json` and `schedules.json` records are
  migrated into `decks.json` as tagged timer decks and the source files are
  renamed to `*.json.migrated` (kept as rollback artifacts). Nothing
  user-visible changes: the Rotations and Schedules pages, MCP tools,
  physical-button behaviour, manual holds, and firing semantics all work
  exactly as before through compatibility projections, and migrated records
  do not appear on the Decks page. Rotations that repeat a page across steps
  migrate too (linkless decks may now repeat pages). An id shared between a
  legacy record and an existing deck gets a `-rotation` / `-schedule`
  suffix, noted in the log. After the move, the Schedules and Rotations
  pages show a one-time dismissible notice explaining what changed and
  where the backups live.

- **Priority now arbitrates across schedules, rotations, and timer decks on
  the same tick** (#167). The scheduler collects all three into one fire
  pass sorted by priority, so a higher-priority rotation or deck advance
  beats a lower-priority schedule for the panel. Previously the three fired
  in fixed passes and a schedule always won the tick regardless of priority.
  Records with equal priority keep the existing landing order (rotation,
  then deck, then schedule), so default-priority setups behave as before.

### Fixed

- **Deleted canvas-born dashboards no longer resurrect after a restart.** The
  legacy standalone-canvas migration runs on every startup and re-created any
  canvas whose page id was free, so deleting such a dashboard only lasted until
  the next update. Deleting a page now also drops the same-id legacy canvas
  doc; canvases that were never deleted keep migrating exactly as before.

### Added

- **The Companion API contract now supports selected Apple Reminders lists as
  one domain source.** Servers advertise accepted schemas through
  `personal_data.sources`; the new strict `reminders` snapshot carries up to
  20 named list groups and 200 incomplete items in aggregate without exposing
  EventKit calendar identifiers. The deprecated `reminders.fridge` source and
  its legacy feature flag remain available only for the already published
  fridge widget; new Companion and widget integrations use `reminders` only.
  The server rejects duplicate list IDs and aggregate item overflow instead of
  truncating them, while an empty list set remains a fresh enabled snapshot;
  deleting the source is reserved for disabling the integration.

- **Physical buttons now work on relay-paired panels** (#180). A button press
  rides the status JSON the panel already posts to its relay mailbox
  (`button` + `button_event_id`, the same fields as the REST status body); the
  home instance dispatches it through the normal button pipeline when it pulls
  the status and uploads the resulting frame for the panel's awake-window
  re-poll. After a press the home poller drops to a fast interval for a burst
  so follow-up presses (deck navigation) aren't collapsed by the relay's
  latest-only status slot, and presses older than five minutes are ingested as
  telemetry but not dispatched. No relay Worker changes; requires firmware to
  include the two fields on button wakes.

- **Offline-album playback state on the Devices card.** The server now ingests
  the collection playback report a storage-capable display sends on its
  heartbeat (state, cached/total frames, synced version) and shows it on the
  device's Status tab while that album is bound, with state/version transitions
  recorded in the events log. Shown as an observation with its age, never as a
  claimed current frame.

### Fixed

- **Expired personal-data snapshots no longer retain raw values.** The store
  removes list names and Reminder contents at `expires_at` while preserving a
  metadata-only tombstone for the `expired` status. Reminder due dates are now
  also validated as real `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar dates for both the generic and
  deprecated source schemas.

- **Revoking a remote panel now actually cuts it off.** The relay Worker's
  revoke deleted the panel's mailbox but left its token record, so a revoked
  panel kept authenticating and saw an empty-mailbox `204` it couldn't tell
  apart from "freshly paired" — the contract's revoked-token `401` never
  happened. Revoke now deletes the token record (plus the pairing records
  holding the plaintext token), so the panel's next poll is a real `401` and
  firmware can drop its pairing unaided. Completing a pairing for a device
  that already has a token also invalidates the old token, so a re-paired
  panel leaves exactly one working credential.

- **Deleting a relay panel from Settings → Devices now revokes its relay
  pairing too.** Previously only the Cloud relay page's revoke button talked
  to the relay; the plain device delete left the mailbox and token lingering.

- **Large offline albums no longer overflow constrained firmware receive
  buffers.** The `/collection` manifest is now paged (at most 64 frame entries
  per response, `?cursor=` continues) instead of listing every folder frame in
  one document; every cache-eligible frame still lands on page one, so
  single-page slice-1 firmware is unaffected.

- **Companion webpage sends no longer time out on asset-heavy sites because
  of repeated DNS safety checks.** The strict public-only Chromium guard now
  classifies each hostname once per page attempt while continuing to validate
  every distinct redirect and subresource host and to fail closed on lookup
  errors.

- **Relay deliveries now show up in the events log.** Each sealed frame or
  config upload to a relay mailbox records a device event row
  (`relay://<id>/frame`, `relay://<id>/config`), and upload failures record
  error rows, so the relay hop of a push is as auditable as an MQTT or REST
  publish. Uploads are deduplicated by digest, so steady pushes don't churn
  the log.

- **Relay pairing now honours the panel's self-reported colour gamut when
  picking the device kind.** A remote panel reporting a non-default gamut
  (a grayscale or BWR firmware build) is created from the most specific
  hardware-catalog kind for its protocol + gamut, so frames pack at the
  right bit depth: an 800x480 4-gray panel now receives 96000-byte 2-bpp
  frames instead of the mono kind's 48000-byte 1-bpp frames, which its
  firmware rightly refused to paint. The operator's explicit kind choice
  still wins, and gamut-less reports behave exactly as before.

- **RSS feeds and webpage screenshots behind bot protection no longer 403**
  (#178). The RSS widget now falls back to fetching through the headless
  browser's network stack (a genuine browser TLS fingerprint, same approach
  the Reddit widget already used) when a plain fetch is refused, and sends
  browser-shaped headers on the plain path. Webpage screenshots no longer
  advertise the HeadlessChrome user agent on external sites, which
  Akamai/Cloudflare-class protection blocks on sight.

### Added

- **Pairing codes for remote panels can now live longer than 10 minutes.**
  "Add a remote panel" gains a "Code valid for" choice (10 minutes to 24
  hours, relay-clamped) for when someone has to travel to the remote
  location before entering the code. Relay Worker redeploy required.

- **Remote relay panels are now configured exactly like local displays.** A
  remote panel's card on Settings → Devices carries the full set of controls
  (sleep interval, button wake, quiet hours, orientation, panel dims,
  calibration), and config edits now actually reach the panel: the home
  instance seals the device's config document with the pairing key and uploads
  it to a new relay config mailbox, which the panel fetches on its next wake
  (conditional GET; the status response now carries the current config etag).
  The relay tab links each remote panel to its device card, the card's badge
  reads "Relay" with relay-appropriate connection details, and the MQTT/REST
  transport switch is disabled for relay panels since flipping one would
  orphan it. Relay Worker redeploy required for the config mailbox routes.

- **Photos sent from the Companion app can now be framed.** The Companion API
  accepts an optional focus + zoom on image uploads (contract 0.6
  `image_framing`, Fill only) and resolves it into a separate source crop for
  each target panel, so one send to a portrait and a landscape display keeps
  the chosen subject on both. Focus coordinates address the photo the way the
  phone displays it (EXIF orientation is normalized first), History returns
  the original framing intent, and resend republishes the retained framed
  frame exactly. The capability is advertised with a mandatory
  `image_framing_max_zoom` bound so clients never hard-code the editor range.

- **Run a panel at another location, without a VPN or opening your network.** A new
  cloud-relay transport lets a remote e-ink panel show your home instance's dashboards
  over the internet. Both ends connect outbound to a small relay mailbox (a Cloudflare
  Worker, hosted or self-hosted), so your home network never accepts an inbound
  connection. Frames are sealed end-to-end (X25519 + AES-256-GCM), so the relay stores
  ciphertext only and can never read a dashboard. Pairing is done remotely through the
  relay, no LAN access to the panel needed. See the remote-panel guide. Panel firmware
  must support decrypting relay frames.

- **Installing a template now asks its questions with real controls, not blank text boxes.**
  A template's declared inputs are resolved against the *installing* server's own widget option
  schemas, so a question about Home Assistant sensors renders as a picker over your entities,
  a location question gets the location search, and selects get their real options. It reuses
  the same `auto_field` controls and coercion as widget configuration, so the two stay in sync.
  The author's declared type is only a fallback, which is the correct inversion: they can't
  know what is valid on your system. Secret inputs stay masked text (an API key has no picker),
  and inputs targeting a raw URL source's transport fields fall back to plain text.

  Each question is also labelled by the element it configures, so a dashboard with three
  sensor tiles asks "Kitchen: Entities" and "Bedroom: Entities" rather than "Entities" three
  times; an untitled element falls back to its position ("bottom left of the dashboard").
  Questions are grouped by the value they replaced, so one API key shared by two sources is
  asked for once and fans out to both, while three tiles watching three different sensors
  stay three separate questions.

- **Phone photos no longer land on the panel sideways.** `fit_to_panel` now normalizes EXIF
  orientation before cropping and fitting. Cameras commonly store a landscape pixel buffer
  plus an orientation tag instead of rotating the pixels, and Pillow does not apply that tag
  on open, so a portrait phone photo rendered rotated. Doing this before the crop also makes
  normalized crop coordinates mean the same thing on both sides of the wire, which the
  Companion's proposed focus/zoom framing depends on.

- **Templates can be reported for takedown.** Every template in the browser gets a Report
  button that files a takedown request into the same review channel, with Take down and
  Dismiss buttons beside it. Anyone can file one, including the install that published the
  template, which is how an author pulls their own work back; a self-report is flagged in the
  review message (advisory, since install ids are forgeable). Taking a template down from
  either message closes any open reports against it, and requests are rate-limited per
  install and per IP.

- **The Share dialog now warns that the preview image is a live render.** The screenshot
  submitted with a template shows whatever the dashboard was displaying at that moment, and
  it reaches reviewers immediately and the public catalog on approval. The dialog says so
  beside the image, suggests duplicating the dashboard with placeholder values if it shows
  anything private, and confirms once more at submit.

- **Large dashboards can be shared again: template previews are downsampled to fit.** A
  1600x1200 render with a photo background exceeded the submission size cap and was rejected
  outright. Previews are now resampled to at most 1200px on the long edge (with a palette
  fallback) before submitting, which keeps them readable in the Discord review embed rather
  than shrinking them to card size, and the server cap is 1MB to match. A render already
  inside the budget is sent untouched at full resolution: flat dashboard art compresses
  better at native size, so resampling it would have made the file bigger and the reviewer's
  view worse.

- **Community templates get their own page, grouped by resolution.** Browse now links to a
  dedicated Templates page where templates are grouped by canvas size, each group labelled
  with the devices that fit those dimensions (portrait mounts matched as "rotated") and the
  resolutions of your own registered panels pinned to the top. Fixes the Install button
  landing on a 404: the editor URL now comes from the server rather than a hardcoded client
  path (the share dialog's preview URL had the same stale path).

- **Settings → System gains an Experiments card.** Every experiment flag (canvas editor,
  MCP API, template marketplace) is now a labelled toggle with its description and resolved
  state; flips take effect immediately with no restart. Flags pinned by a
  `TESSERAE_EXPERIMENT_*` env var render locked with the reason. Also fixes the MCP card's
  Disable button, which posted a value that parsed truthy and silently re-enabled the API
  instead of disabling it.

- **Template marketplace (experimental): share and install community dashboard templates.**
  Behind the new `templates` experiment flag and the master online switch. Sharing (a new
  action in the panels editor) exports a canvas dashboard through a sanitizer that strips
  request headers and secret-flagged options (a new `secret` flag on `cell_options`;
  `rest_service` url/headers carry it), clears install-specific values (HA entities,
  locations) into declared install-time inputs, inlines small page-asset backgrounds, and
  runs a credential lint that blocks anything key-shaped; submissions go to api.tesserae.ink
  and are human-reviewed before appearing publicly. Browse gains a Community Templates
  section: cards show a stable pseudonymous author (sponsors get an emblem and a custom
  name), installing fills the template's declared inputs (secrets entered masked, staying
  local) and creates a new unbound dashboard. Removing a template from the catalog never
  touches dashboards already created from it. The privacy page documents exactly what a
  submission contains.

- **Panel view: preview a dashboard as the e-ink panel will actually paint it.** The
  dashboard editor's live preview gains an HTML view / Panel view toggle. Panel view
  quantises and dithers the render to the target panel's colour palette, so you see the
  exact per-pixel output (dithering, palette reduction) before pushing, per preview group's
  gamut. Also adds a shared source-crop primitive (a normalized crop + rotate applied before
  the panel fit) that the Send and Companion image paths will build framing on.

- **Companion dashboard listings now include their Phosphor icon name.** The
  optional `icon` field uses the same bare identifier as the web dashboard
  list, so companion clients can render a consistent icon and safely fall back
  when a dashboard has no icon.

- **Icon references that resolve to no glyph are named instead of rendering a blank box.**
  `render_report` now always includes `icon_invalid` (mirroring `tap_invalid`): unknown slugs or
  weights on `icon` elements, bad `icon`-transform bind-table values, and a heuristic scan of
  code/html/svg markup for `ph-<name>` classes that aren't real Phosphor icons, each with the
  element id and reason. The `GET /api/mcp/icons` search normalises its query to slug form
  (`ph-` prefix stripped, underscores as dashes), so `ph-heart` and `calendar_heart` now match
  instead of returning zero results. The canvas renderer falls back to bold for an unknown icon
  weight rather than building a class that matches no stylesheet. Agent docs (server and bridge)
  spell out the two markup traps: regular weight needs both classes (`ph ph-heart`), and a wrong
  slug fails silently.

- **Render diagnostics: `render_report` gains `debug=1`, so silent render failures name
  themselves.** The diagnostics section reports, per render: console errors/warnings from every
  frame (a throwing code-element script surfaces tagged `[code-el <id>]`, including uncaught
  async errors and CSP-blocked loads inside the sandbox), uncaught page errors, failed and
  4xx/5xx network requests with URLs, per-font-face load status
  (`loaded | pending-at-capture | failed | never-requested`, with the `@font-face` src), authored
  element CSS the browser silently dropped (selector + declaration + reason, via a re-parse
  diff), which vendored bundles each code element inlined, and the settle record that gated the
  screenshot (goto / compose-signal / image-wait / font-wait outcome + elapsed ms). One
  `render_report(debug=True)` call now names problems that previously took pixel-diffing dozens
  of renders. `render_preview` and `render_report` also accept `fresh=1` to bypass the last-good
  fallback and widget data caches (`?fresh=1` now works on `/compose/<id>` itself), so a stale
  cached result can't derail an investigation. A live-Chromium regression suite pins the
  acceptance case (throwing script + 404 font + dropped CSS rule, one call names all three) and
  that identical page content yields identical font/asset outcomes across runs.

- **The MCP surfaces the icon set and code-element toolkit to agents.** `list_widgets()` now
  returns the vendored code-element libraries (Chart.js incl. the datalabels and Sankey plugins,
  canvas-gauges, Day.js, qrcode, marked, chroma, SVG.js, Phosphor) and an icon descriptor, and a
  new `GET /api/mcp/icons?q=` searches the 1500+ Phosphor names so an agent picks real slugs
  instead of guessing. The `tesserae-mcp` bridge exposes the search as a `list_icons` tool.
  Previously these were only described in the prose instructions, so agent-built dashboards
  under-used icons, charts, and the toolkit.

- **Companion API 0.5: send a public image URL or a webpage to your displays.** Community
  clients can push a public image URL, or a server-rendered screenshot of a public webpage,
  to explicit displays as asynchronous jobs, with the same History, resend, and photo
  layout-mode handling as an uploaded image. Both run a strict public-only URL policy with no
  client override: private, loopback, link-local, reserved, and embedded-credential
  destinations are refused, including redirect hops (re-validated during the fetch, and by a
  per-request interceptor during the webpage render). Webpage sends need a browser pool and are
  advertised only when one is present.

- **Companion clients can inspect the exact frame waiting for a sleeping
  display.** A REST device with `has_pending_render` now includes an optional
  `pending_render` revision and authenticated preview URL. The existing device
  preview endpoint accepts that revision while preserving its default
  last-served meaning, so clients can present Current and Next without guessing
  from global History or racing a newer render.

- **Companion display cards distinguish served and pending frames.** REST
  `/frame` polls now retain the last frame handed to each device, including
  matching `304 Not Modified` confirmations. The Companion device preview uses
  that served frame while `has_pending_render` reports when a newer render is
  waiting for the panel's next wake; MQTT and push transports continue to use
  the latest server render.

- **Companion API 0.4 adds canonical History and all five photo layout modes.**
  Community clients can page through the same push History shown in the web UI,
  fetch retained composition previews, and idempotently resend an entry to its
  original display snapshot while respecting quiet hours. Successful jobs may
  include the exact new History event IDs, and image uploads now advertise and
  accept Fit, Fill, Blur, Stretch, and Center.

- **The opt-in daily heartbeat now includes a bucketed count of paired companion apps.** Same
  `0`/`1`/`2-3`/… bucketing as the device count, derived server-side from the live companion
  tokens (never a client name, install id, or app version), so adoption of the community
  companion app is visible without the app itself ever contacting api.tesserae.ink. Sent only
  when online features are enabled, like the rest of the heartbeat; see the privacy page.

- **REST devices work on publicly-hosted instances (opt-in).** A new Settings → Server → Network
  toggle, "Allow REST clients on public networks" (off by default), lets a device fetch its
  rendered frame over a public address using a signed, short-lived URL the server hands it after
  it authenticates. Off, render artifacts stay reachable only from your LAN or an authed session;
  on, the operator accepts that a device's signed frame URL is fetchable from the internet until
  it expires. Unsigned public access is always refused, and no firmware change is needed.

### Fixed

- **Panel view toggle now actually switches.** Selecting Panel view appeared to do
  nothing: the preview iframe's `display: block` overrode the `hidden` attribute the
  toggle set, so the live render stayed on top of the quantised image, which itself
  rendered at full panel resolution outside the frame. Both are fixed (explicit
  `[hidden]` override on the iframe; the panel image reuses the raster preview's
  letterboxed `object-fit: contain` box). The HTML-view button is also renamed from
  "Fit view", which read as a sizing control.

- **Saving a REST device no longer emits a misleading MQTT publish failure.**
  REST instances can retain dormant MQTT topics for a later transport switch;
  device settings now follow the active transport, save to disk, and return on
  the next status poll without attempting a broker publish.

- **CalDAV discovery handles compressed responses.** A Nextcloud behind a proxy or CDN
  can return a gzip- or deflate-compressed body; Python's HTTP client doesn't request or
  decompress that, so the parser saw a binary blob and discovery failed with "wasn't valid
  CalDAV XML." Discovery and the feed fetch now request an uncompressed body and decode
  gzip/deflate if the server compresses regardless, and the diagnostic log includes the
  response's content type and encoding.

- **CalDAV discovery tolerates a stray BOM or whitespace before the XML declaration.**
  Some servers (notably Nextcloud behind certain PHP / output-buffering setups) emit a
  newline ahead of `<?xml`, which a browser ignores but a strict parser rejects, so an
  otherwise-valid calendar listing failed with "wasn't valid CalDAV XML." Discovery now
  trims anything before the first tag, and logs the raw response start when a body still
  won't parse.

- **The Schedules "Next 24 hours" timeline and last-fired times respect the configured
  timezone.** They were computed from the server's clock (UTC on a typical Docker install),
  so the "Now" marker, hour ticks, and projected fire times sat an offset away from the
  operator's wall clock and reloading didn't help. They now use the configured app timezone.

- **Grayscale and Spectra 6 / ACeP panels report their real palette to companion and MCP
  clients.** The colour-capability lookup only matched the canonical gamut ids, so a panel
  declared with a chemistry alias (`spectra_6`, `acep_7colour`) fell through and was reported
  as monochrome; it now resolves aliases and returns the full 6/7-colour palette. Three
  grayscale kinds that already render multiple grey levels but were tagged `mono` are corrected
  (reTerminal E1001 grayscale and Xteink X4 grayscale to 4-level; reTerminal E1003 to a new
  16-level `gray_16` gamut), and editing a grayscale panel's settings no longer rewrites it to a
  colour gamut.

- **The refresh button now works on a plain bound dashboard.** Pressing refresh on a
  display that isn't driven by a rotation or deck re-renders whatever dashboard it is
  currently showing and sends it, instead of doing nothing. A device that has never
  displayed a dashboard still no-ops, since there is nothing to refresh.

- **Layout preset thumbnails no longer distort on extreme panels.** The little
  split-pattern hints in the dashboard editor now use a fixed aspect ratio
  instead of the panel's, so a very wide or small display (e.g. a 296x128
  Magtag) gets readable, uniform preset tiles. The interactive custom-layout
  board still matches the real panel shape.

- **Companion Activity now keeps exact History and display identity.** Multi-panel
  dashboard pushes preserve every canonical History event ID in their terminal
  Job, and button-triggered fetch rows snapshot the originating device ID, so
  clients no longer need title/time heuristics to suppress duplicate Activity
  cards or identify the display that fetched a frame.

- **Companion display previews now match each display's selected photo layout.**
  The server retains a separate logical-screen PNG after Fit, Fill, Blur,
  Stretch, or Center and device underscan are applied, so portrait displays no
  longer show the unfitted source composition in the iOS app. Hardware-only
  row-stride rotation and mount compensation remain confined to the device
  artifact, while preview ETags, upgrade backfill, and artifact pruning track
  the logical frame independently.

- **The Webpage widget captures JavaScript pages after their data loads.** It was
  screenshotting the moment the embedded page fired its `load` event, before a data-driven
  page (a weather dashboard, an SPA) ran its post-load fetch and painted, so the panel showed a
  blank frame even though the editor preview looked right. The widget now waits a short settle
  window after load, with a "Settle delay (seconds)" cell option (default 2) you can raise for
  slow pages.

- **Photo sends to portrait-native ESP32 panels keep their visual orientation.**
  Send-page and Companion uploads are now fitted into the display's composition
  dimensions before the renderer reconciles that composition with the
  firmware-native row stride. Landscape photos sent to devices such as the
  reTerminal E1004 no longer rotate 90 degrees clockwise while History remains
  upright.

- **Battery analytics now separate charging from drain phases.** The Device batteries page
  shows live `Charging` / `Charge rate` / `Full in` values without labelling a positive charge
  ramp as `Drain rate`, and retains the preceding clean discharge slope as `Last drain rate`
  when available. Robust Theil-Sen fits prevent a single glitched reading or post-unplug voltage
  relaxation drop from dominating either estimate, while raw chart samples remain unchanged.

- **v2 staleness is anchored to layout, not pixels (live bench round 3, 2026-07-25).** A region
  report against a superseded frame digest now dispatches when that frame's untrimmed region-id
  set matches the live one, resolved through a new ~10-generation digest lineage per device; a
  dashboard whose pixels re-render every 30 s no longer drops every tap that races a render.
  `stale` means the layout genuinely changed or the digest is too old to resolve.

- **Extraction races can no longer kill touch.** A capture whose code-element mirrors hadn't
  posted by screenshot time extracts zero regions; that empty result no longer overwrites a
  populated sidecar for an unchanged composition, and an empty manifest rebuild for a page whose
  cached manifest had regions serves the cached manifest re-anchored (with a warning) instead of
  a structurally-valid 0-region manifest the device would hold until the next good redraw.

- **Anti-aliasing jitter no longer mints frames.** The composition diff gained a per-channel
  tolerance (10/255, below the 16-level gray quantization): chart canvases and browser text
  jitter between captures of visually identical content inflated the changed area past the patch
  budget, forcing a full-frame mint and a full e-ink flash on every re-render. Sub-tolerance
  re-renders now hold the digest and stage nothing; real changes ride patches as designed; a
  divert that still fails logs its reason at warning level.

- **v2 region reports now dispatch (live bench round 2, 2026-07-25).** Sidecar action specs from
  code-element markup are raw JSON strings; the manifest builder and the region-id resolver
  classified and dispatched the unparsed string, so every served manifest carried
  `action.type: '{"action"'` garbage and every `/tap` region report failed. Specs now pass
  through the same `coerce_action` normalisation the v1 dispatch path uses, in the one helper
  both the builder and resolver share — HA actions classify as tier 1 / `ha` and dispatch.
  `/tap` region reports also speak the firmware's wire vocabulary: `ok` on success, `stale` /
  `deduped` / `ha_failed` unchanged, and specific diagnostics (`no_action_for_region`,
  `action_error`, `provenance_blocked`, `resolver_exception`) instead of a mute `error`.

- **`/frame/data` answers 200 for every known digest.** A frame with no slots and nothing staged
  returns an empty values document instead of 404, so a device can't latch data-off mid-linger
  and miss the patch a tap stages a second later; 404 now means an unknown digest only.

- **Manifest region trim is priority-ordered and audited.** Over-budget frames keep navigation,
  then sliders, then taps, then swipes (document order within each class), and the dropped
  region ids are logged by name instead of tail sections silently going dead.

- **Protocol v2 manifest delivery survives re-renders (live bench, 2026-07-25).** Every `/frame`
  200 for a proto-2 device now carries the manifest block: non-interactive frames get a valid
  empty manifest instead of silence (a manifest-less 200 reads as "v1 server" and latched the
  device out of region dispatch), a lost sidecar re-anchors the last built manifest for the same
  composition, and pixel-only re-renders keep the manifest digest stable so the device re-anchors
  without a re-fetch. `/frame/manifest` and `/frame/data` also keep answering for a
  just-superseded frame digest for a ~60 s grace window, so a device mid-linger on the old digest
  is not orphaned by a re-render (its artifacts and sidecars are prune-protected for the window).

- **`/status` value/patch envelopes now gate on the sticky capability.** A beat that omits the
  `overlay` advert, or a pure-v2 firmware that only sends `proto`, no longer loses
  `overlay_values` / `overlay_patches`; patch reconciles and push diverts likewise accept
  `proto >= 2` as patch-capable alongside overlay schema 2.

### Added

- **Protocol v2 server surfaces (device-owned touch).** Devices advertising `proto: {v: 2}`
  (sticky, persisted) get: interaction manifests (`GET /frame/manifest?digest=`, plus a pointer
  on `/frame` responses) with stable region ids, tier/type classification, feedback modes, and
  text regions; region-id action reports on `POST /tap` validated by re-minting ids from the
  frame's own sidecar; a Server-Sent Events channel (`GET /stream`) carrying values / patches /
  sync envelopes with keepalives; and state bundles (`GET /bundle`) projecting the warmed deck
  cache into digest-addressed frame states with a navigation links table. v1 responses stay
  byte-identical for devices that don't advertise the capability. Contract:
  `docs/protocol-v2-touch.md`.

### Removed

- **Schema-1 overlay specs** (protocol v2 cleanup, see `docs/protocol-v2-touch.md`). The
  `GET /frame/overlay/<digest>` endpoint and the `build_spec` document builder are gone: v1
  firmware probing the endpoint gets a 404, which its contract has always defined as
  feature-off, so it degrades to dispatch-without-echo until the protocol-v2 interaction
  manifest ships. The atlas store, values document, patch documents, touch dispatch, and the
  overlay capability handshake are unchanged; non-touch rendering is byte-identical.

### Added

- **Frame patches now actually stage under real dithering, and periodic small changes ride them
  too.** The patch diff moved to composition space (before per-renderer dithering): the .bin
  family's default error-diffusion dither made a one-tile change perturb the packed bytes of
  nearly the whole frame, so the wire-space diff always blew the budget and every reconcile fell
  back to a full frame — the schema-2 path never engaged on hardware. Composition rects now map
  through the same transform chain as tap targets and the blob is cut from the new artifact.
  On top of that, scheduled and push-triggered re-renders whose visual diff is small (a header
  clock tick) are delivered as patches on the current digest for schema-2 REST devices showing
  the same page: no full e-ink flash per clock tick, and stable digests mean a tap fired around
  a render can no longer be dropped as stale. Explicit repaint intents (resend, force publish)
  and big diffs still mint a new digest.

- **Overlay capability survives restarts.** The advertised overlay schema persists in the
  device-facts store and re-seeds the status cache at startup, so a patch-capable panel isn't
  demoted to full-repaint reconciles between a server restart and its next heartbeat.

### Fixed

- **Overlay values `seq` is now milliseconds.** Second-granularity seqs made two value changes
  inside one second dedup to a single repaint under the firmware's newest-wins rule.

### Added

- **Post-action frame patches (overlay schema 2).** After a touch action fires a Home Assistant
  service call, the server re-renders the page headless, diffs the wire framebuffer against the
  frame on glass, and stages only the changed rects as a patch document (`patches` on
  `GET /frame/data`, `overlay_patches` on `/status`, blob via `GET /frame/patch/<digest>`).
  Capable firmware partial-refreshes those rects: state text catches up within a couple of
  seconds, with no full download, no full e-ink flash, and the digitizer live throughout.
  Documents are anchored to the served frame digest with a strictly increasing `seq` and are
  dropped the moment a newer frame lands, so a patch can never revert a pending push. Caps:
  12 rects / 256 KB per document; past that the server falls back to a normal full frame.

- **Overlay value slots: attribute paths, value maps, code-element support.** Slot keys accept
  an attribute path (`ha:light.desk:attributes.brightness`), a slot can declare
  `data-overlay-map='{"on":"1","off":"0"}'` to render non-numeric states with the numeric glyph
  atlas, and slots inside code-element sandboxes are now collected through the same mirror
  mechanism as their touch regions.

### Changed

- **The post-HA repaint no longer runs inside the touch wake.** The synchronous re-push (full
  render + download + flash while touch was locked, roughly one action per 10 s) is replaced by
  a debounced background reconcile that re-renders whatever the device is showing: rotation
  step, deck page, or the last directly-pushed page (previously, devices without a rotation
  never repainted at all and kept 304ing until the next schedule). Patch-capable devices
  reconcile ~0.4 s after the last tap of a burst; everything else gets one coalesced full push
  ~3 s after (`app.touch_patch_debounce_s` / `app.touch_repush_debounce_s`).

### Added

- **Pages own their update cadence (discussion #140).** Every dashboard gains an "Updates"
  setting on the Dashboards list (only when pushed / every minute / 5 min / 15 min / hourly /
  daily). The scheduler re-renders the page on that cadence and delivers only to panels
  currently showing it (resolved from deck position, rotation position including manual holds,
  or a device bound to exactly one page); nobody showing it means no render at all. Freshness is
  now a property of the page's content, not a side effect of rotation dwell: a clock page set to
  "every minute" stays live through a 15-minute rotation step. Delivery respects quiet hours,
  and unchanged renders still answer battery panels' polls with 304. Default is "only when
  pushed" (no behaviour change for existing pages).

### Fixed

- **Deck home-return now respects quiet hours on its promote fast path.** The timer-driven
  return-to-home could repaint a panel inside its quiet window when a pre-warmed frame was
  available (the push fallback already gated itself); the return now defers until the window
  ends on both paths. Hand navigation and the Push button remain quiet-exempt (user-initiated).

### Added

- **Deck editor: pick pages, done ("dense rail + inspector").** Decks get a dedicated
  create/edit surface (Decks -> New deck / Edit): a flip-order rail of page cards with
  thumbnails, click-to-append page library with suggested clusters, an inspector for the
  selected card (home toggle, return-after slider, per-page refresh override, reposition /
  remove), inline settings bar (name, device chips, cadence, Advanced with entry page + a
  live-derived navigation-graph view), and a one-line behavior summary. Navigation derives
  automatically from the flip order; no graph authoring needed. Fully submittable without
  JavaScript (membership checkboxes + numeric order fallback).

- **Deck home card with idle return.** Mark a member page as home and set "return here after"
  (slider, 0-120 min): the deck returns to it after that long without a button press or tap,
  enforced server-side for server-navigated panels and shipped in the sync manifest (`home`
  block) so SD-cache firmware enforces it offline. Push sends the home page to the panel first;
  a fresh device's entry page defaults to home.

- **Deck sync manifests: swipe triggers and capacity awareness.** Link tables now carry swipe
  triggers (authored directions mirrored from the graph; paging defaults where silent: swipe
  left = next, swipe right = back), and when a device's advertised SD capacity can't fit the
  whole deck, overflow pages are marked `cache: false` with ring-from-home priority instead of
  letting the card overfill mid-sync.

### Added

- **Rotations re-render at every dwell boundary, including onto themselves (discussion #140).**
  Previously a rotation only rendered on step *transitions*, so a step's widget data froze for
  its whole dwell (a device poll fetches the already-rendered frame; it never triggers a render),
  and a single-step rotation rendered exactly once, ever. A rotation now fires whenever a new
  dwell window begins, even when the step is unchanged, so a one-page rotation with a 5-minute
  dwell simply means "keep this page fresh every 5 minutes". The min-hold flap guard still
  applies to step changes but not to self-fires. Alongside this, rotation fires now exclude
  panels sitting inside a manual button/touch hold (previously any fire could yank a paged-away
  panel back mid-hold; now the rejoin pass restores them only when the hold lapses).
  (Supersedes the `refresh_minutes` setting that briefly shipped in v0.190.0; rotations saved
  with it still load, the field is ignored and dropped on next save.)

### Fixed

- **Devices paged away by button/touch now rejoin their rotation (discussion #140).** The
  scheduler only pushed on step transitions, so on a rotation dominated by a long-dwell step a
  panel that was manually paged away (physical button / touch) stayed on the manual page
  indefinitely: the manual hold (`override_until`) was recorded but nothing acted when it lapsed.
  A per-tick rejoin pass now pushes the rotation's current page, device-targeted, to any device
  whose manual hold has lapsed, then clears the hold; devices still inside their hold are
  untouched, and a device already on the current step just has its hold cleared. Hold length
  remains "rest of the day" by default, or `app.button_hold_seconds` when set.

### Added

- **Decks navigate without a hand-built graph.** Where a deck page's graph is silent, sync
  manifests now synthesize default links (`left`/`right` to prev/next in deck order, wrapping,
  plus left-half/right-half tap zones on touch panels when the page has no zones or markup touch
  regions of its own), and server-side button handling applies the same prev/next default for
  deck-bound devices, so a graph-less deck navigates identically on-device and via the server
  (previously `right` fell through to the rotation map and read as "refreshed but didn't
  navigate"). Explicit graph links always win. MCP `create_deck` with a bare page set now derives
  the graph from the pages' `page:<id>` tap/swipe links automatically (bridge 0.8.2 documents it).

- **Push button on the Decks page.** One click warms every page for every bound device, sends the
  entry page to the panel(s), and seeds the nav position, so a new deck goes live immediately
  instead of waiting for the scheduler's warm tick. Deck cache hygiene is documented in
  client-protocol.md: digests are content-addressed, so only pages with volatile content
  (clocks, "last updated") churn the deck version.

### Fixed

- **Completed firmware updates stayed labelled as queued.** The Firmware page now distinguishes
  retained canary/fleet rollout membership from a release that is still newer than the device.
  Once a device reports the imported version it reads as up to date, while pending rows name the
  actual imported release instead of a potentially newer online Available version.

- **Deck heartbeat reports could revert a freshly pushed dashboard.** v0.187.1's report promotion
  promoted whatever page the panel said was on glass, so a heartbeat arriving between a push and
  the device's next fetch clobbered the pending frame with the older deck frame, and the new
  dashboard (and its touch zones) never landed. Promotions from reports and from touch
  reconciliation now carry a recency guard: what's on glass only wins the live slot when it isn't
  older than what's pending there. A touch on stale glass still dispatches against the frame the
  finger actually touched; it just can't revert the pending push.

- **Buttons and touches were permanently deduped after a device power cycle.** The firmware's
  wake-event counter is RTC-backed and restarts at 0 on any power cycle (battery pull, crash,
  reflash), usually without re-pairing since the token survives in NVS; the server's dedup rule
  treated anything `<=` the persisted high-water mark as a retry, so a restarted counter had every
  subsequent button and touch silently swallowed. Dedup is now equality-only (a genuine retry
  resends the same id; a lower id is a restart or an offline-queue replay and dispatches), and the
  re-pair paths (`/register` on an existing id, `/discover` MAC claim) additionally clear the
  dedup state outright.

- **Touches were dropped as stale after deck local navigation.** When firmware paints a deck page
  from its SD cache, the panel shows a frame the server never served via `/frame`, so the touch
  stale-check rejected every subsequent stroke, and a routine conditional poll could even repaint
  the panel backwards to the pre-nav frame. A digest that matches a deck-cached render is now
  reconciled instead of dropped: the frame is promoted into the live slot (ETag polling 304s, nav
  position recorded) and the stroke hit-tests against its composition. `deck_page_id` reports do
  the same promotion, and report ingestion now runs before button/touch dispatch on `/frame` and
  `/status` so same-wake events resolve from the page actually on glass. Digests matching nothing
  are still dropped as stale.

### Added

- **Per-device overlay target budgets (firmware v1.9).** The overlay capability now carries the
  device's own tap-echo buffer size (`overlay: {schema, max_targets}`, 32 on current E1003
  firmware); the server trims target lists to the advertised value, treating absence as the v1.8
  baseline of 8. When a frame has more touch regions than the budget, navigation targets
  (`page:` / `step:` / `rotate_*`) win the echo slots ahead of miscellaneous actions, and
  survivors always emit in document order. Spec size is guarded against the firmware's 8 KB parse
  buffer. The MCP device list now reports `overlay: {max_targets}` so agents can design within
  the real per-panel budget.

- **MCP surfaces the deck-cache and overlay capabilities.** `/api/mcp/devices` entries now carry
  the hardware `kind` plus firmware capability flags from live heartbeats: `overlay: true`
  (instant tap echo + live value slots apply on that panel) and `deck_cache: {capacity_bytes}`
  (radio-off deck navigation). `render_report` extracts `overlay_slots` alongside `tap_regions`
  (also in `?view=touch` and `?fields=`), so an agent can verify a `data-overlay-key` annotation
  survived the render. The tesserae-mcp bridge (0.8.1) documents the live-value-slot vocabulary
  and its server-enforced guardrails (8 slots, 2 font buckets, numeric charset, 47-char values,
  `ha:` keys only, widget-markup-only extraction) in the handshake instructions.

- **Overlay value slots + glyph atlases (hybrid render mode, schema 1 slice 2).** Widgets can mark
  an element `data-overlay-key="ha:<entity_id>"` (optional `data-overlay-suffix`) and capable touch
  firmware repaints just that slot with live values during a wake, no full re-render. The slot's
  box, alignment, font size, and weight are extracted in the same Playwright pass as touch regions
  (sidecar v3); glyph atlases are rasterized through the same browser + Inter faces as the
  composition so blitted text is pixel-identical, packed 4bpp to the firmware's strip contract, and
  served content-addressed at `/frame/overlay/atlas/<digest>`. Live values come from
  `GET /frame/data?digest=` (pre-formatted strings via the ha_core plugin) and piggyback as
  `overlay_values` on `/status` responses for capability-advertising devices. Firmware caps
  honoured server-side (8 slots, 2 atlases by largest group, 32 glyphs, 47-char values); every
  failure path degrades the spec to rect-only. Contract updated in docs/dev/client-protocol.md.

- **Overlay specs for touch boards (hybrid render mode, schema 1).** Firmware with fast partial
  refresh (reTerminal E1003 first) advertises `overlay: {schema: 1}` and fetches
  `GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame/overlay/<digest>`: a rect-only draw list of tap-echo targets
  derived from the frame's touch-region sidecar, transformed server-side into wire-framebuffer
  pixel space (rotation, flip, scaling, underscan all applied at spec-build time, so the firmware
  uses coordinates verbatim). A tap inside a target inverts and partial-refreshes that rect locally
  in a few hundred milliseconds while the stroke still dispatches to the server as normal. Works
  for both live frames and deck-cached frames; capability is sticky per device. Value slots and
  glyph atlases are the next schema slice. Contract in docs/dev/client-protocol.md ("Overlay
  specs").

- **XIAO ePaper 7.5" black/white/red variant.** `bwr_3` is now a canonical packer gamut: the
  `esp32_bin` renderer packs tri-colour panels to the native 2-bpp layout (96000 bytes at 800x480,
  MSB-first, 0b00 black / 0b01 white / 0b10 red; the reserved 0b11 is never emitted), sharing the
  BWRY 2-bpp path. New `xiao_epaper_75_bwr` hardware SKU on the same `esp32_bw_client` protocol as
  the mono board, so reflashing a unit between mono and BWR firmware migrates its registration
  automatically (same-protocol kind heal) while keeping the device row, token, and history.

- **Deck cache sync for devices (on-device SD frame cache).** Firmware with local storage can now
  cache a bound deck's pre-rendered frames and navigate button/touch links on-device (wake, read
  card, paint; no WiFi round trip). New device-facing surface: a `deck_cache` capability advertised
  in heartbeat bodies (current-state per beat, withdrawn the moment a card disappears), a
  `GET /api/v1/device/<id>/deck` manifest (page frame digests, byte sizes, TTLs, and the link graph;
  cold pages are warmed on demand), digest-addressed frame fetch at
  `GET /api/v1/device/<id>/deck/frame/<digest>` with immutable cache headers, a `deck.version`
  envelope on `/status` responses so firmware knows when to re-sync, and `deck_page_id` reporting on
  `/status` bodies and `/frame` query params so locally-navigated pages keep the server's nav
  position truthful. Devices that never advertise the capability see byte-identical responses
  everywhere. Contract documented in docs/dev/client-protocol.md ("Deck cache sync").

- **2-bit grayscale renderer + reTerminal E1001 grayscale variant.** New `esp32_gray2_bin` renderer
  packs compositions to 4-level grayscale at 2 bpp (96000 bytes for 800x480; MSB-first, 0b00 black,
  0b11 white, linear) for UC8179-class mono panels driven in their 4-gray waveform mode, and a
  `seeed_reterminal_e1001_gray` hardware SKU pairs it with the grayscale firmware build. Same
  `esp32_bw_client` protocol as the mono SKU, so the registration variant picker offers both and an
  already-registered E1001 migrates automatically when its firmware re-declares the gray kind.

- **Stale device kind auto-heals on re-pair (#121).** A device that first registered under a generic
  protocol kind (e.g. `esp32_client`) and later comes back declaring its hardware-catalog SKU
  (e.g. `seeed_reterminal_e1004`) is now moved to the declared kind instead of staying pinned to the
  one it first paired as. Applies on `/register` re-pair and on the `/discover` MAC-claim path a
  re-flashed device actually hits; restricted to kinds sharing the same wire protocol, so a heal can
  only refine which board, never move a device across protocols. Fixes devices being silently exempt
  from per-kind OTA rollouts because releases are keyed by the SKU kind while the instance sat under
  the generic one. The device's cached render is invalidated on a move so `/frame` serves 204 until
  the next push repaints at the new kind's geometry.

- **OTA rollout UI (Settings → Firmware) (#121).** A guard-railed admin page over the same per-kind
  rollout state the CLI writes (never a parallel store). Per device kind it shows the current release
  and its verified manifest (fw_version, key_id, sha256, size, image host), and the rollout controls:
  import + verify a `descriptor-<kind>.json` (rejected with the verifier's reason if the signature or
  key doesn't check out, or the kind is unknown), set a canary from the kind's OTA-capable devices,
  promote to the whole kind (disabled until a canary reports `confirmed` on that version, with a
  confirm dialog stating how many devices will be offered it), and pause/withdraw. A fleet view lists
  each device's firmware version and OTA phase chip, floating `rolled_back` / `failed` to the top;
  devices that never advertised OTA support show "USB update only". Every action is event-logged. The
  page never fetches the image bytes; it shows the URL and the devices fetch it themselves.
  When online mode is on, each kind also shows whether a newer firmware has been published
  (api.tesserae.ink's per-kind update check, cached hourly) with an "available" badge, and a
  one-click "Import from release" that fetches the release's signed descriptor (host-allowlisted),
  verifies it against your trust anchor, and sets it as the release, no manual download. The check
  now sends the reported firmware version (`?current=`) so api.tesserae.ink can aggregate version
  distribution. When online mode is off the check never runs and the page discloses that turning it
  on pings api.tesserae.ink with the kind ids and reported firmware versions; rollout itself stays
  fully offline.

- **OTA state reporting is ingested server-side (#121).** A device that speaks OTA reports where it is
  in the update lifecycle on the `ota` object of its heartbeat (`phase` / `reason` / `target_fw` /
  `attempt_id` / `detail`, per the contract's State reporting section). The server now records the
  latest report on the device's live status, shows it as a chip on the Devices card (green
  `confirmed`, red `failed` / `rolled_back`, amber `rejected`, neutral in-progress), and appends an
  event-log row on each lifecycle transition (a terminal report re-sent every heartbeat logs once). A
  capability-only or `idle` beat leaves the last outcome standing. The report is advisory; the
  device's own first-boot checks remain the acceptance gate.

### Fixed

- **OTA release path crashed on the Docker image, and shipped no trusted keys (#121).** Two packaging
  gaps blocked the first canary. `app/ota/release.py` imported `packaging.version` at module scope,
  but `packaging` was never declared and is absent from the slim image, so the release CLI and the
  `/status` release-delivery path (which imports `is_newer`) both raised `ModuleNotFoundError`. The
  version comparison now uses a small internal plain-SemVer helper (`app/semver.py`) with no
  third-party dependency. Separately, the Dockerfile did not copy `ota/`, so `load_trusted_keys()`
  found an empty registry at its default `ota/keys` dir; the image now includes it.

- **Resend from History never reached devices served by a per-device renderer clone (#119).** A
  resend replayed the stored composition as an unbound fan-out, and unbound pushes deliberately skip
  clone renderers (`<base>__<device>`, the #83 guard), so for a bound device the resend published
  nothing: the device's latest-frame entry kept pointing at the newer frame and its REST `/frame`
  poll answered 304 against the resent frame's differing ETag. The push history row already snapshots
  the delivery targets, so a resend now replays those exact targets (and the matching panel dims)
  through the fan-out.
- **Canvas editor: HA entity filter, icon picker, and per-entity overrides were dead (#130).** The
  canvas config drawer injects a widget's options form after page load, but the canvas editor template
  is standalone and never loaded the icon-picker / entity-overrides modules, and the multi-select
  filter wiring lived only in the grid editor. So for the Home Assistant "Entities" widget the filter
  box did nothing, the icon picker didn't open, and the per-entity label / icon / number-format
  overrides never rendered. The filter is now a shared component wired in both editors, the two modules
  load on the canvas page, and the drawer initializes all three after injecting the form.
- **Canvas preview failed behind a non-default external port (#129).** When the server was reached on a
  port that differs from its internal bind (a reverse proxy, k8s Service, or Docker port map sending
  external 4567 to the container's 8765), the canvas preview and other render routes built the internal
  loopback fetch from the browser's port, so the headless renderer hit `127.0.0.1:<external>` where
  nothing listens and the render was refused. The `tesserae` CLI now records its real bind port in
  `TESSERAE_BIND_PORT` (previously set only by the Home Assistant add-on), so the renderer always
  fetches `/compose` on the port Flask actually binds.
- **Status bar showed the wrong device's battery (#125).** Four gaps fed the same symptom, a status
  bar falling back to the lowest battery / signal across all devices (and the wrong temperature /
  humidity). (1) Per-device render detection only scanned grid cells, so a canvas dashboard pushed once
  per panel instead of per device; it now scans canvas elements too. (2) Even when a canvas push fanned
  out per device, the canvas render path dropped the target device before the widget fetch, so every
  panel still resolved the aggregate; the target now threads through to the fetch. (3) Editor previews
  (the dashboards-list hover thumbnail and the live compose iframe) carry no target device, so both
  grid and canvas previews showed the aggregate; a preview now defaults to the page's first bound
  device and shows a real one. (4) The per-device fan-out decision read the plugin registry off
  `current_app`, which is absent on the scheduler and rotation push threads, so scheduled refreshes
  silently dropped the fan-out and a grid panel kept showing the aggregate even when a manual Send was
  correct; the push manager now holds a direct registry accessor.

### Added

- **`fetch_latest` button action.** Re-downloads and repaints the latest frame
  already rendered for the device without running the composer, publishing a
  new artefact, moving the rotation, or setting a manual override. The action
  bypasses a matching `If-None-Match` for its `/frame` response, so its meaning
  does not depend on a particular firmware clearing its cached ETag first.
- **MCP: rotations, schedules, and decks.** The agent MCP surface (`/api/mcp`) and the
  `tesserae-mcp` bridge now expose list / create / delete for rotations and schedules, and list /
  create / delete / suggest for decks, so an agent that builds pages can also wire how they cycle
  (rotations), when they push (schedules), and how they group for instant navigation (decks).
  `suggest_decks` derives a ready-made deck from the `page:<id>` tap / swipe links already on page
  elements, so the agent can offer a deck once it has wired inter-page navigation.
- **Decks page reshaped around the canvas.** The Decks page is now a management surface, not a graph
  editor: you author navigation in the canvas editor (tap / swipe "go to page" on tiles), and the
  Decks page suggests a deck from those links, then owns the deck-level concerns, refresh cadence
  (deck default + per-page), devices, entry, enable, delete. A **Sync from links** button re-derives
  a deck's graph (and touch zones) from the current page links, and the raw JSON graph editor is
  demoted to an "Advanced" fold for manual tweaks.
- **Per-page refresh cadence in decks.** A deck page can set its own
  `refresh_interval_minutes` (in the graph editor or via MCP), overriding the deck's default, so a
  volatile tile can re-warm every few minutes while a photo page in the same deck refreshes rarely.
  `0` warms the page only on first navigation; unset inherits the deck cadence.
- **Decks: pre-rendered, navigable page groups.** A new Decks page (next to Rotations) groups pages
  into a small linked graph that Tesserae keeps pre-rendered per bound device, so a button press or
  touch that moves between them serves an already-rendered frame instead of rendering on the fly. Each
  page links to others by a physical button name or a touch zone; the scheduler re-warms a deck's
  pages in the background on the cadence you set, so their data stays current. Removes the on-the-fly
  render latency from navigation (the download and e-ink repaint still happen). Build a deck under
  Decks: name it, bind devices, set the refresh cadence, and define the page graph. Decks can also be
  **suggested automatically**: when pages link to each other via tap / swipe "go to page" actions set
  in the canvas editor, the Decks page offers a one-click deck for each cluster, with the graph and
  touch zones derived from those links.
- **OTA per-kind rollout: manual promote + canary (#121).** Beyond staging a build for a single
  device, an operator can now set a signed build as a device kind's release and roll it out
  deliberately: `python -m app.ota.release set` (offered first to the canary devices you list),
  `promote` (to every device of the kind), `pause`, `clear`, `list`. On `/status` the server offers a
  device its kind's release when the device is eligible (a canary, or the release is promoted) and the
  release firmware is newer than the version the device reports; a per-device staged descriptor still
  wins. The device-side apply/verify/rollback firmware is tracked separately, so nothing reaches a
  device until that ships.
- **OTA production signing (Cloudflare Worker) and trusted-key registry (#121).** A Cloudflare Worker
  (`packages/ota-signer/`) signs firmware descriptors with an Ed25519 key held only in a Worker
  secret and serves the images from R2, co-locating signing with storage; its output is byte
  identical to the Python signer. Published public keys live in `ota/keys/<key_id>.pub`, and
  `python -m app.ota.stage` now verifies a descriptor's signature against the key matching its
  `key_id` before staging, refusing a mis-signed one (`--insecure-skip-verify` to override). Keys are
  keyed by `key_id` so they rotate without a re-flash. The staging gate is server-side; firmware
  embeds its own key set as the real trust anchor.
- **OTA capability handshake and `/status` delivery (Phase 2, #121).** A device advertises OTA
  support with an `ota: {schema: N}` object in its register/status body; the server hands back a
  staged, signed descriptor on the always-200 `/status` response only when the device advertised a
  compatible schema and the descriptor targets its kind. Descriptors are staged per device with
  `python -m app.ota.stage` (pipeline: `sign` then `stage`), held in `data/core/ota_pending.json`,
  and picked up on the next heartbeat. `/frame` is untouched, so the image channel stays byte-clean
  for every device kind. The production key, R2 image hosting, and OTA state reporting are later
  slices.
- **Button wake window for ESP32 devices (#123).** A per-device `button_wake_s` config field (0-60
  seconds, default 0) that keeps the device awake for a moment after a button press changes the page,
  so scrolling several pages doesn't pay a fresh wake and Wi-Fi cycle per press. Set it under
  Settings → Devices. The value is delivered on the `/frame` response a button wake already fetches
  (and via the config block on register/status), so firmware reads it without an extra request; 0
  keeps the current behaviour of sleeping immediately, and it applies only to button wakes, not
  scheduled refreshes or rotation. Firmware support lands separately.
- **OTA update contract (Phase 1).** The signing and verification half of the over-the-air
  firmware update flow: an Ed25519-signed `{payload, signature}` descriptor binds the target device
  kind, firmware version, image URL, size, and SHA-256. `app/ota/` carries the signer (with a
  `python -m app.ota.sign` CLI), the reference verifier (signature, then manifest shape, then target,
  then image digest, each failure a stable reason code), and the wire contract at
  `docs/ota/contract.md`. `tests/fixtures/ota/` publishes a test-only key and four signed fixtures
  (valid, wrong key, truncated, digest mismatch) so device firmware can self-test the verifier before
  the live pipeline exists. Descriptor delivery on `/status` behind a capability flag, and image
  hosting, are separate follow-up slices.

### Fixed

- **Calendar discovery: adding one collection no longer hides the rest (#124).** After a CalDAV
  discovery, adding a discovered calendar redirected to a bare page that dropped the other found
  collections. The add now re-renders the discovery list (the added one marked "already added", the
  rest still one-click addable), so a server with several calendars can be added in a few clicks.

## [0.152.0], 2026-07-19

### Added

- **OpenDisplay device kind.** A new `opendisplay` device kind for OpenDisplay BLE e-paper tags,
  driven by the separate `tesserae-opendisplay` bridge: Tesserae renders a full-colour PNG (via the
  `pi_png` renderer) and the bridge polls the frame over REST and pushes it to the tag over Bluetooth
  LE, where the OpenDisplay SDK dithers for the tag's panel. REST-polled, honours `sleep_interval_s`.
  The panel size is set per tag at registration, so one kind covers every OpenDisplay panel.
- **OpenDisplay via Home Assistant.** A second OpenDisplay path for people already running Home
  Assistant with the OpenDisplay integration: the new `opendisplay_ha` device kind writes each
  rendered frame into HA's media folder and calls the `opendisplay.upload_image` action, so HA owns
  the Bluetooth and no separate bridge or BLE hardware runs on the Tesserae host. Set the tag's HA
  device id on the device; each tag targets its own, so it scales to many tags. The frame uses a
  stable per-device filename overwritten in place (no media-folder growth), and orphaned files are
  swept on startup and when a device is removed. Best when Tesserae runs as the Home Assistant
  add-on with a shared `/media`; requires the Home Assistant Core plugin.


- **Touch interactions guide (#49).** A new docs page covers enabling touch, attaching tap / swipe /
  slider / hotspot / code-element actions in the editor, verifying with the touch monitor, and
  implementing touch on any client (the transport is device-agnostic: ESP-IDF, CircuitPython, a Pi,
  or any HTTP client, not just the reTerminal firmware).
- **"Fade old" toggle on the touch monitor (#49).** Dims older touch marks by recency so the latest
  activity stands out against the history.

### Added

- **Set the log level on self-hosted installs (#122).** A `--log-level` flag and a `TESSERAE_LOG_LEVEL`
  environment variable set the root log level (trace / debug / info / warning / error) for Docker, LXC,
  and bare installs, which previously had no way to change it from the hardcoded INFO. The flag wins
  over the env var; the Home Assistant add-on keeps using its own Log level option.
- **OpenDisplay-via-HA tags report battery, signal, and firmware.** These tags never heartbeat
  Tesserae directly (Home Assistant owns the Bluetooth link), so a background poller pulls each tag's
  battery / signal-strength / temperature / firmware from its HA entities (matched by device class,
  via `/api/template`) and reshapes them into a normal heartbeat. It flows through the same pipeline
  every other device uses, so the device card's battery, signal, and firmware tiles, the battery-drain
  history, and the event log all populate with no tag-side reporting. Polls every 15 minutes by default
  (`app.opendisplay_telemetry_interval_s`).
- **Pick the OpenDisplay tag from a dropdown instead of pasting an id.** Both the Add-device form's
  OpenDisplay tab and the device card now list the OpenDisplay devices Home Assistant knows about
  (queried over HA's `/api/template` endpoint, no WebSocket), so you select the tag by name and
  Tesserae stores the correct device id. When the tag's model string carries a resolution (e.g.
  `296x128`), it also fills the panel size. Falls back to manual entry when Home Assistant isn't
  reachable. The underlying `ha_device_picker` config field type is reusable by any HA-targeting
  device kind.

### Changed

- **OpenDisplay is a transport choice when adding a device.** The Add-device card's transport control
  gains an "OpenDisplay" option alongside REST and MQTT. It detects whether Tesserae is the Home
  Assistant add-on: if so it offers a short form to add the tag (pushed via `opendisplay.upload_image`),
  otherwise it points at the standalone bridge and the REST pairing tab. The "Issue pairing code"
  button also aligns to the note field and stacks full-width on narrow viewports instead of
  overflowing the card.
- **The canvas and grid editors share one touch Interaction picker (#49).** The canvas editor had its
  own copy of the Interaction UI (on-tap / swipe / slider / code-element actions); it now uses the
  same `touch_interaction.js` module the grid editor does, so the two can't drift and an editor-side
  fix (e.g. decoding a Home Assistant action back into the form) only has to be made once.

### Fixed

- **Physical buttons and touch swipes advance rotations built in the UI (#122).** The Rotations page
  saves a rotation with an empty `device_ids` (meaning "drive whichever devices the step pages are
  bound to"), but the button / touch handler only matched rotations that named the device explicitly.
  So no rotation created in the UI ever advanced on a `left`/`right` press or a swipe: the device just
  re-served its current frame, and the press showed in History as a red "failed" row. The handler now
  honours the same page-binding fall-through the scheduler uses, and benign button outcomes (no-op,
  duplicate, unmapped, dispatched) are labelled as such in History instead of "failed".
- **The "Issue pairing code" button lines up with the note field.** The button sat ~12px below the
  input because the field wrapper's block padding extended the flex row's baseline; the pairing-row
  field now has that padding zeroed so the button's bottom meets the input's.
- **OpenDisplay-via-HA no longer times out on slow BLE pushes or blocks the push pipeline.** A BLE
  e-paper transfer can take tens of seconds; the 10s HTTP timeout fired mid-push and masked Home
  Assistant's own error, and because push listeners run synchronously it would also have stalled the
  pipeline. The upload now runs on a single background worker (BLE is serial anyway, so pushes
  coalesce to the newest frame) with a 120s timeout, so a push returns immediately and HA gets time
  to finish or report the real failure.
- **OpenDisplay-via-HA surfaces the reason `upload_image` failed.** When Home Assistant returns a 500
  for `opendisplay.upload_image`, the log now includes HA's response body (the integration's actual
  error) instead of just "HTTP Error 500", so a failed BLE push is diagnosable without digging
  through HA's own logs. The **HA device id** help text and docs now spell out that it's HA's internal
  device id (a long hex string), not the tag's own name/serial, which was an easy mismatch to make.
- **Resending a frame from History now re-paints REST clients (#119).** A resend force-republishes
  over MQTT, but a REST/HTTP-polled client comparing the content-addressed ETag would get a 304 and
  skip the re-paint when the resent frame was byte-identical to what it already showed. Resend now
  flags the frame so `/frame` serves one 200 to force the re-fetch, then clears the flag so the next
  unchanged poll is 304 again (the deep-sleep battery path is unaffected).
- **OpenDisplay-via-HA can write frames to the media folder.** The container drops to an unprivileged
  user, but Home Assistant mounts `/media` root-owned, so the first frame write hit
  `PermissionError` and no frame reached the tag. The entrypoint now creates and chowns the
  `/media/tesserae` subdirectory while still root (HA core keeps read access), and the publisher logs
  one actionable warning instead of a traceback per render if the folder still isn't writable.
- **OpenDisplay devices no longer read as MQTT.** Both OpenDisplay kinds carried a `status_topic` in
  their manifest, which tagged them as MQTT devices and showed dormant MQTT topic rows. Neither uses
  a broker: the OpenDisplay-via-HA kind now declares a new `push` transport (delivered through Home
  Assistant's `opendisplay.upload_image`, badged "HA"), and the bridge kind declares `rest` (the
  bridge polls the frame endpoint). Existing instances are normalised on load, so a device added
  before this fix corrects itself without re-adding. Both device cards also gain an OpenDisplay setup
  note that detects whether Tesserae is the HA add-on and links to the integration or the bridge
  accordingly.
- **Code-element touch regions built asynchronously are no longer lost (#49).** A code element that
  builds its tappable DOM in JS (fetched data, a chart, any delayed render) had its `data-on-tap`
  nodes scanned once, ~32ms after load, before they existed, so the region never reached the sidecar
  and every tap on it resolved to `no_target`. The sandbox collector now re-scans on DOM changes and
  reports the full set each time (the host rebuilds the mirror regions from it), with a short quiet
  settle bounded by the existing timeout, so a late-appearing annotated node still registers.
- **Swipe zones are more forgiving (#49).** A swipe was hit-tested only on its start point, so a
  stroke that began a hair outside a small zone and moved into it registered as `no_target` even
  though its tail crossed the zone. Swipe hit-testing now falls back to the stroke's end point when
  the start didn't land on a region declaring that direction, so a swipe onto a zone fires reliably.
  Taps are unchanged (still strict start-point), and sliders (a press-on interaction) aren't affected.
- **Home Assistant touch actions no longer fail with HTTP 400 (#49).** The touch dispatcher called HA
  through `call_service_with_response`, which always appends `?return_response` — and HA rejects that
  with 400 for any service that doesn't support returning a payload (most actuators, e.g.
  `light.turn_on`). A tap that resolved and dispatched correctly still came back `ha_failed`. Touch/
  button HA actions now use a plain `call_service` (no `return_response`); the response variant stays
  for the read-style services that need it (`todo.get_items` et al).
- **Touch actions show correctly in the canvas editor (#49).** Touch actions are now stored in their
  canonical `{action,domain,service,data}` form at write time (a model validator, so it applies to
  MCP writes, editor saves, and self-heals legacy dashboards on load). Previously an agent-written
  flat HA action (`{service,entity_id,brightness_pct}`) dispatched fine but was stored raw, and the
  editor's Interaction panel — which only decodes the canonical shape — showed it as blank/`Custom`.
- **Touch actions written in the flat Home Assistant shape now dispatch fully (#49).** An action like
  `{"service":"light.turn_on","entity_id":["light.hall"],"brightness_pct":50}` validated as fine but
  silently dropped `brightness_pct`: only `entity_id` was folded into the call. Top-level service-data
  keys are now hoisted into `data` (an explicit `data` block still wins), and a comma-joined
  `entity_id` string normalises to the list HA expects, so the flat form dispatches the same as the
  nested canonical one.
- **Structured swipe actions can be authored (#49).** `on_swipe` was typed as a direction→string map,
  so an inline HA object (`{"left":{"action":"ha",...}}`) was rejected at write time and the
  interaction never stored. A swipe direction now accepts the same string-or-structured forms as
  `on_tap`. A swipe object with no `up`/`down`/`left`/`right` key (which can't fire) is flagged in
  `render_report`'s `tap_invalid` with a fix hint instead of being silently dropped.

### Added

- **Touch authoring ergonomics for MCP agents (#49).** Four additions from agent-session feedback:
  a `describe_actions` MCP tool / `GET /api/mcp/actions/describe` returns the authoritative
  touch-action vocabulary (element fields, string grammar, the HA object form and every input
  variation, slider `{value}`, provenance, how to verify) so it doesn't have to be reverse-engineered;
  `render_report` takes `?view=touch` or `?fields=…` to trim the response so verifying a large board
  doesn't blow the output cap; a bulk element endpoint (`POST /pages/<id>/elements/bulk`, all-or-
  nothing) builds a big primitive board in a few chunked saves instead of one giant `set_canvas`; and
  the touch monitor gains a dashboard picker that previews any dashboard's touch regions at the device
  panel size without pushing it first. Bridge published as 0.7.0 with the matching tools.

- **Self-hosted CalDAV calendars + todo lists (calendar_core).** Calendar feeds can now carry basic
  or digest credentials, so a private server (Baikal, Radicale, Nextcloud) that gates its `.ics`
  export behind auth works, including a LAN-only server the panel can't reach directly (fetches run
  server-side). A **Discover** panel takes your CalDAV calendar-home URL and enumerates the calendars
  and todo lists it finds via one PROPFIND, so you add each in a click instead of hand-building
  `?export` URLs. calendar_core also parses `VTODO` components now (`load_todos`), which the new
  CalDAV Todo widget renders as a read-only checklist. Credentials are stored in the plugin's
  `feeds.json` (plaintext in the data dir, same posture as the Home Assistant token).

### Fixed

- **Artifact GC no longer eats the live frame's touch regions (#49).** The render prune (and the
  History page's per-row delete) kept only digests still referenced by event rows, so once the event
  cap evicted (or a History clear deleted) the push row for a frame still on a panel, its
  touch-region sidecar and thumbnail were removed from disk. From then on every tap resolved
  `no_target`, interactions stopped carrying actions, and the touch monitor had no regions to
  overlay. The latest render for every device (artifact + composition digest) is now always kept.
  Recovery on an affected install: push the dashboard once and the sidecar regenerates.

- **MCP element writes reject unknown fields (422).** Unknown element keys were silently ignored, so
  an agent writing `tap` instead of `on_tap` (or any misspelled field) got a 200 while the
  interaction evaporated. The element write paths (append / patch / whole-document) now return 422
  naming the unknown keys and pointing at `on_tap` / `on_swipe` / `on_slide`, so the mistake
  surfaces at write time instead of as a dead panel.

### Added

- **Touch linger on by default for the reTerminal E1003 (#49).** `touch_linger_s` now defaults to
  30, so after a touch wake the firmware stays up polling the digitizer directly and follow-up taps
  dispatch in a few hundred ms instead of paying the ~2.7 s deep-sleep boot each time. Delivered
  through the `/status` response `config` block like every other device setting; set it back to 0
  in the device's settings to sleep immediately. Touch input itself stays opt-in.

- **Speculative pre-render of likely next frames (#49).** During a touch session the server now
  prewarms the compositions a follow-up gesture is most likely to ask for (the rotation steps either
  side of the current one) on a background thread, so the synchronous push a swipe or page tap
  triggers skips its Playwright capture, the dominant share of post-touch latency. Entries are
  consume-once with a 60 s TTL and keyed on the page's content token, so an edit mid-session or a
  scheduled push minutes later can never be served a stale composition.

- **Touch ETag stability locked by regression tests (#49).** A touch whose action doesn't change
  the canvas must leave the frame ETag untouched: renders are content-addressed, the packers are
  deterministic, and the touch re-push path doesn't force-publish, so an unchanged canvas resolves
  to `no_change` and the device's next `/frame` poll 304s. On the E1003 every false-positive 200
  costs a 1.3 MB download and a ~30 s panel repaint, so this chain is now pinned by tests at both
  the REST layer (no-op touch → 304 against the prior ETag) and the push layer (unchanged re-push
  keeps the digest).

- **Touch monitor Clear now sticks (#49).** Clear only wiped the on-screen marks, but the monitor
  re-seeds from touch history on load, so the events reappeared on refresh. It now deletes this
  device's recorded touch events server-side (scoped to `touch` events for that device, so push and
  button history is untouched), so the clear survives a reload.

- **Home Assistant touch actions written in the natural shape now fire (#49).** A structured HA
  action only dispatched when written in the exact canonical form; the shapes an agent naturally
  writes (no `action` key when a `service` is given, `entity_id` at the top level, a dotted
  `service:"light.turn_on"`, or the HA-native `target`) silently no-op'd. These now normalise to the
  canonical form and dispatch, and sliders accept `$value` as well as `{value}`. Execution is
  server-side through the ha_core connection (a POST to `/api/services/...`), not the read-only
  ha_service data source.
- **`render_report` no longer green-lights dead touch actions (#49).** It now returns `tap_invalid`,
  regions whose declared action would not dispatch (box + gesture + reason), so verification reflects
  what will actually fire instead of echoing a stored-but-undispatchable payload. A region appearing
  in `tap_regions` only means it was stored; `tap_invalid == []` is the real "this dashboard is
  wired" signal. The panels touch-regions endpoint reports the same.

### Added

- **Per-device touch monitor (#49).** A touch-capable panel (the Seeed reTerminal E1003) gains a
  **Touch monitor** page, linked from its device card, that draws the panel at its true aspect ratio
  and plots recent touches on it: taps as dots, swipes as arrows, sliders with their value, each
  colour-coded by outcome (fired / no target / blocked). The last render's touch regions overlay so
  you can see whether a tap landed inside its target, and events stream in live over the Events SSE
  feed. Seeds from the recent `touch` history on load, so you get the last session's misses without
  waiting for a fresh tap.

- **Touch events on the Events page (#49).** Touch strokes now log as their own `touch` event type
  with a dedicated filter chip, instead of being folded into the push feed. Every touch is recorded,
  including the misses (`no_target`, `stale`, `blocked`), which are the diagnostically useful ones,
  with a scannable summary (gesture, coordinates, resolved action, region) and the full JSON payload
  on expand. Handy for confirming a tap landed where you expected and fired the right action.

- **Touch capability flag on devices (#49).** Panels with a touch digitizer (the Seeed reTerminal
  E1003) now report `touch: true` through the device APIs, the MCP `list_devices` / `/devices`
  surface and the canvas editor's device list. Previously nothing in the device registry indicated
  a panel was touch-capable, so an agent inspecting the devices couldn't tell the E1003's on-tap /
  swipe / slider actions would actually fire on it. It's a hardware fact carried from the hardware
  catalog entry, distinct from the per-device `touch_enabled` firmware setting.

- **Touch actions in the grid dashboard editor (#49).** The touch authoring that shipped for the
  canvas editor is now on grid dashboards too: each cell's **Advanced** pane gains a full
  Interaction editor, on-tap and per-direction swipe actions (refresh / rotate / jump to step / go
  to page / webhook / Home Assistant), and "Make this a slider" to map a drag to a 0-100 `{value}`
  for a webhook or HA call. The picker UI is a shared `touch_interaction.js` module so the grid and
  canvas editors stay consistent, backed by ungated `dashboards.json` + `ha-actions.json` endpoints
  so it works without the canvas experiment.

- **Home Assistant touch actions and sliders (phase 3 of #49).** The Interaction picker gains
  **Home Assistant…**: choose a service and entity (fetched live from your HA instance via the
  shared ha_core connection) plus optional service data, and a tap on the element fires the call.
  It runs synchronously and re-pushes the current page, so the frame the display gets back on that
  same wake already shows the new state. Any element (or invisible touch region) can also become a
  **slider**: the stroke's end point maps to 0-100 along the chosen axis (vertical fills upward, and
  a plain tap sets the value at that point), and `"{value}"` placeholders in the action receive the
  number, e.g. `light.turn_on` with `{"brightness_pct": "{value}"}` for a one-stroke dimmer, or a
  webhook URL like `…/level/{value}`. Sliders work on grid cells too. Structured HA actions are
  honoured only from editor/MCP-authored config or a code element's named actions map, per the
  touch provenance gate.

- **Touch actions in the canvas editor (phase 2 of #49).** Every canvas element gains an
  **Interaction** section: pick an on-tap action (refresh, rotate, jump to step, go to page,
  webhook) and per-direction swipe actions, with a hand badge on interactive elements and in the
  Layers list. A new **Touch region** palette entry drops an invisible hotspot you can position
  over anything, including a code element's rendered output. Code elements get a named **Actions**
  card (mirroring Sources): define actions with pickers, reference them from markup as
  `data-on-tap="@name"`, in static HTML or JS-built DOM alike. A toolbar **Show touch targets**
  toggle renders the canvas headless and overlays the extracted regions, flagging unresolved
  `@name` references. The MCP `render_report` now returns `tap_regions` + `tap_dangling` so agents
  can verify their annotations. Dispatch gains a provenance gate: side-effecting actions (webhooks,
  and Home Assistant actions when they land) only fire from user-authored config (editor/MCP fields,
  code-element actions maps), never from raw widget markup; navigation actions work from anywhere.

- **Touch input protocol (server side).** Touch-capable devices can now report taps and swipes and
  have them drive the dashboard (#49). A stroke arrives either as `touch_*` query params on the
  existing `GET /frame` poll (deep-sleep clients get the action's repaint on the same wake, exactly
  like button wakes) or via a new `POST /api/v1/device/<id>/tap`; the device stays a thin client and
  the server does all gesture classification (tap vs directional swipe) and hit-testing. Touch
  regions are declared in markup, not drawn: any element in the composed page can carry
  `data-on-tap` / `data-on-swipe` attributes (the existing button-action grammar: `refresh`,
  `page:<id>`, `rotate_next`, `webhook:<url>`, …), including DOM generated inside a canvas code
  element. Grid cells take a per-cell `on_tap` override plus a widget-manifest `on_tap` default.
  Regions are extracted at render time from the exact DOM the frame captured (shadow roots
  included) and stored beside the render, and a stroke is only ever dispatched against the frame
  the finger actually touched (stale strokes degrade to a plain refresh). Touch events land in the
  History page alongside button presses. The reTerminal E1003 (GT911 touch panel) gains
  **Touch input** and **Touch linger** device settings delivered through the standard config
  channel; firmware support lands separately in the unified device firmware.

- **Manual history controls.** The History page auto-evicts at a cap, but now you can also clear it
  by hand: a "Clear history" control deletes everything or everything older than 7 / 30 / 90 days,
  and a per-row checkbox with a floating bulk bar (like the Dashboards multi-select) deletes just the
  ticked entries. Orphaned render artifacts are pruned after any bulk delete. (#116)

- **"Update available" badge in the header.** When a newer Tesserae release exists, the topbar shows
  an accent-tinted update badge (with the version) linking to Settings. The check reads
  `api.tesserae.ink/version/latest` for the running version, entirely in the background off the
  request thread (a cached, single-flight refresh with a 6h TTL), so no page render ever blocks on
  it. It's gated by the online-features opt-out exactly like the heartbeat, so an opted-out install
  makes no call and shows nothing, and the install id is scoped (a one-way derivation) before it's
  sent. Compares against the latest stable release; an install already ahead of stable (a source /
  edge build) simply shows no badge rather than a false nag.

- **Choose how Home Assistant numbers are formatted.** HA widgets rounded every numeric state to 2
  decimals and trimmed trailing zeros, so a column mixing `21.00` and `20.55` rendered as `21` next
  to `20.55`. A new widget-level **Number format** option fixes the decimal places using the same
  pattern vocabulary as the canvas data element (`0`, `0.0`, `0.00`, …); blank keeps the old auto
  behaviour. Applied across the HA family where it fits: **Sensor** and **Entities** also take a
  per-entity override from a per-row format box in the names/icons editor, and **History** formats
  its current / min / max labels. Purpose-built HA widgets (Battery, Climate, Energy, Media, Lights)
  keep their fixed, unit-aware precision. `ha_sensor` 0.7.0, `ha_entities` 0.6.0, `ha_history` 0.5.0.
  (#111)

- **Daily heartbeat now reports firmware versions per device kind.** The opt-in heartbeat already
  sent the set of configured device kinds but not what firmware they run, so the maintainer couldn't
  see the firmware spread in the field. It now includes `fw_by_kind` (`{kind: [versions]}`), sourced
  from each device's latest status heartbeat, deduped and capped. Aggregate only, no per-device
  identity; documented on the privacy page.

- **Bundled fonts are now usable inside the code element.** A code element can use any bundled font
  by family name (`font-family: "Fira Code"`, `"Press Start 2P"`, …). The sandbox has no network and
  a `font-src data:` CSP, so a new `/fonts/face/<id>.css` endpoint serves a self-contained `@font-face`
  (woff2 embedded as a `data:` URL), and the sandbox inlines only the fonts a given element actually
  names. Previously only Phosphor was available in code elements; the whole `fonts_core` set (including
  the new programming + pixel fonts) now works there. Bridge doc-shape updated so the agent knows.
  Bridge 0.5.13.

- **16 new fonts: a big programming + pixel set.** Core fonts (`fonts_core` 0.5.0) gains a broad
  monospace / coding set (Fira Code, Source Code Pro, Martian Mono, Red Hat Mono, Fragment Mono,
  Spline Sans Mono, Overpass Mono, on top of the existing JetBrains Mono / IBM Plex Mono / Space
  Mono) and a pixel / bitmap set (Press Start 2P, VT323, Silkscreen, Pixelify Sans, Handjet, Micro 5,
  DotGothic16, Jersey 10, Jersey 25). All Latin-subset woff2, OFL/Apache, verified to load in-browser.

- **Multi-select dashboards for bulk push / delete.** The Dashboards page now has a checkbox per
  dashboard and a floating action bar that appears once one is selected, with "Push selected" and
  "Delete selected". Push fans each dashboard out to its own bound devices; delete removes them all
  after a confirm. New `POST /send/pages` and `POST /pages/bulk/delete` endpoints back it.

- **All six Phosphor icon weights in the canvas code element.** The sandbox previously only had bold;
  it now has thin, light, regular, bold, fill, and duotone, each vendored as a self-contained CSS with
  the font embedded as a `data:` URL and inlined only when its class (`ph`, `ph-thin`, `ph-duotone`, …)
  appears in the code, so an element that uses one weight doesn't pay for the others. Verified all six
  load and render under the sandbox CSP.

### Changed

- **MCP agent binds the device early and builds visibly.** The bridge instructions now open with a
  "START HERE" step: pick the panel with `list_devices`, `create_canvas_page` sized to it, then
  `bind_devices` **right away** rather than only at push time, so the artboard and Send / schedule /
  rotation target the real hardware from the start (previously the agent left a dashboard unbound
  unless asked). The same step tells the agent to add an empty `code` element and stream it in with
  `append_code` (the open editor re-renders each chunk) and preview early, instead of composing the
  whole thing silently and posting one big `set_canvas` at the end, so the build stays responsive.
  Bridge bumped to 0.5.14.

- **The MCP agent defaults to the code element for dashboards.** Guidance now tells the agent to build
  a dashboard as a `code` element (HTML/CSS/JS fed by widget sources, with the vendored toolkit) for
  anything beyond a trivial single-widget page, falling back to bare widget/data/shape elements only
  when the page really is just one widget. Bridge bumped to 0.5.12.

- **Hover preview on the Dashboards page.** Hovering a dashboard row shows a scaled-down preview of
  it. The preview is a cached PNG screenshot, rendered via the same headless path a push uses and
  reused, keyed by a content token so it only re-renders when the dashboard actually changes. The
  render happens in the background off the request thread (a single-flight queue): the first hover of
  a new/changed dashboard falls back to a live `/compose/<id>` iframe while the image renders, and
  subsequent hovers serve the cached PNG. It lazy-loads after a short hover-intent delay, covers grid
  and freeform pages alike, and is disabled on touch / narrow screens.

- **Bind a canvas to multiple devices.** The canvas editor's device picker is now a multi-select
  popover: a canvas can target any number of panels, and Send fans the one render out to each,
  fitted/quantised to its own dims by the server. Matching the artboard to a specific panel's
  resolution is now a separate, explicit per-device action (⤢), decoupled from binding so a
  mixed-size fleet doesn't fight over one artboard. On the MCP side, `push_to_device` already fanned
  out to a device list; a new `bind_devices` tool (`POST /api/mcp/pages/<id>/devices`) persists the
  target set on the page so agent-built dashboards can be scheduled to the same panels. Bridge 0.5.11.

### Changed

- **MCP agent designs in full colour, not just the raw panel inks.** The canvas agent's guidance
  (bridge doc-shape + the `/devices` colour capability) told it to "design within the panel palette
  so colours don't quantise away", which pushed it to flatten layouts to the handful of Spectra 6 /
  ACeP inks and threw away what dithering buys. The panel actually dithers the full-colour
  composition (Floyd-Steinberg) down to its inks, so rich colours, gradients, and photos reproduce
  as blended approximations. Guidance now says to design in full colour and reserve exact palette
  hex only for fine detail (thin text / small icons) where dithering reads as speckle, and to honour
  the `mono` flag for genuinely grayscale panels. Bridge bumped to 0.5.10.

### Fixed

- **Grid dashboard editor: reload-on-change fields no longer pop a spurious "Leave site?" dialog.**
  Picking a target device, a cell's widget, a layout preset, or refitting the panel saves every form
  then reloads the editor (the server reshapes the page). That reload left the page still flagged
  dirty, so the browser's unsaved-changes guard fired: choosing "stay" cancelled the reload and left
  the status stuck on "Saving…" (even though the change had already been saved), while "leave" let it
  through and looked like leaving had saved. These paths now mark the page clean once the save
  completes and before the reload, so they persist and refresh silently; genuinely unsaved text edits
  still warn on navigate and discard on leave as before. (#115)

- **Render pipeline no longer starves its own worker threads.** The headless screenshot self-requests
  `/compose/<id>`, which needs a free web-server thread to be served; a blocked render holds its
  caller's thread for up to ~105s, and every open SSE stream (the event log, the canvas editor) pins
  one for the life of the connection. With only 8 waitress threads, a couple of open editors plus a
  render or two could leave nothing free to serve the inner `/compose`, so every render timed out
  (`Page.goto: Timeout 15000ms`) and the task queue backed up. The default thread count is raised to
  24 (overridable via `TESSERAE_THREADS`), and the dashboards hover preview now renders in the
  background rather than on the request thread, so a burst of hovers can't pile onto the pool.

- **Heartbeat device count no longer reads "10+" on every install.** `build_payload` counted
  `registry.all()`, which includes the 20+ built-in device kinds and hardware SKUs (catalogue
  entries, not owned hardware) alongside the operator's actual device instances. So every install
  reported the `10+` bucket regardless of how many panels it drives. The count, transport, and kind
  set now key off instances only (`kind_of` set).

- **Install identifier no longer rotates on a transient read hiccup.** The install-id loader treated
  "file exists but couldn't be read right now" (a transient I/O / permission error, e.g. the
  container-boot `chown` race) the same as "corrupt", and self-healed by minting a fresh UUID that
  **overwrote** the still-valid file, permanently changing the install's identity (which surfaced as
  the ID appearing to change across updates). A present-but-unreadable file is now left untouched: the
  boot uses an ephemeral ID and the next healthy boot recovers the real one. Genuinely corrupt files
  still self-heal.

- **Spectra 6 panels no longer pick up a 7th colour.** The CircuitPython PNG/BMP path mapped a
  `spectra_6` panel to the 7-entry palette that carries orange (that palette exists for the Pi-side
  inky path, which reprojects to its own gamut). A CircuitPython client paints exactly what arrives,
  so the extra ink showed up as `DarkOrange` (`#FF8C00`) in the output on a 6-colour panel. The gamut
  now maps to the 6-colour Waveshare E6 palette (black/white/red/yellow/blue/green), and the unknown /
  unset-gamut fallback matches. (#118)

- **Gallery accepts BMP uploads.** The Picture, Gallery widget filtered BMP out of both the file
  picker and the server-side upload check, so a pre-dithered `.bmp` couldn't be added. `.bmp` is now
  an allowed suffix; thumbnails and serving already handled it. (#117)

- **Stable Home Assistant add-on now tracks releases again.** The `release.yml` workflow
  published each GitHub Release with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and GitHub does not let that
  token trigger downstream workflows, so `sync-addon.yml`'s stable-channel job never fired and the
  add-on's stable version froze (it lagged at 0.65.0 while releases reached v0.100.0). `release.yml`
  now explicitly dispatches the sync via `workflow_dispatch` (the documented exception that does fire
  from `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so every release bumps the stable add-on. Edge was unaffected.

### Added

- **PicPak listed under supported hardware.** The README's supported-hardware section gains a
  Community table crediting the [PicPak 4.2" BWRY](https://docs.tesserae.ink/hardware/picpak/)
  client, a community firmware by [@varanu5](https://github.com/varanu5).

- **Canvas code elements can show remote images.** The `code` element sandbox now allows
  `img-src` from the web (`https:` / `http:` / `data:` / `blob:`), so a code element can paint
  a Spotify album cover, an Unsplash photo, or any other remote artwork it pulls from a source,
  the same external images ordinary widgets already render. Isolation is otherwise unchanged: this
  is images only (a one-way GET); `fetch` / XHR / WebSocket stay blocked by `default-src 'none'`, and
  the frame keeps its opaque origin (no same-origin or credentialed access to Tesserae). Bridge
  doc-shape updated so the agent knows remote `<img>` works; bridge bumped to 0.5.9.

- **Service plugins: a non-placeable `service` plugin kind that feeds the canvas code element.**
  A new manifest `kind: "service"` exposes a whole external API as a data source for a `code` / `data`
  element without appearing in the canvas picker (it has no placeable render). The MCP agent discovers
  them via `GET /api/mcp/services` (and the `list_services` bridge tool), then sources one by key exactly
  like a widget: `POST /widgets/<key>/data` (probe) and `GET /widgets/<key>/options` work unchanged. By
  convention a service probed with empty options returns a self-describing map of the scopes it offers,
  so the agent can explore the API before choosing what to pull. Four reference services ship: **Open-Meteo**
  (no key: current / hourly / daily / air quality / marine), **REST / JSON** (any public https endpoint, with
  a loopback/private-host SSRF guard), **Home Assistant** (reuses the ha_core connection: states / entity /
  history / services / config / raw), and **Spotify** (marketplace, reuses spotify_core: now-playing / queue /
  top / raw Web API GET). The plugin schema now allows non-placeable kinds to leave `supports.sizes` empty.
  Bridge bumped to 0.5.8.

- **Stream a code element in live (MCP `append_code`).** A new `POST /pages/<id>/elements/<eid>/append`
  endpoint (and `append_code` bridge tool) appends text to a code element's `html` / `css` / `js` and
  saves on each call. Since a save is what pushes the SSE update to an open canvas editor, an agent
  can stream a code element in chunk by chunk and watch it build up, rather than the whole blob
  appearing at the end. Returns the field's new length; bridge doc-shape documents the pattern
  (add the empty code element, then append). Bridge bumped to 0.5.7.

- **Code elements get a rich sandbox toolkit + editor polish.** The `code` element's sandbox now
  has a vendored, self-hosted library toolkit, each **conditionally inlined** (loaded only when the
  code references it, so unused libs cost nothing): Chart.js + chartjs-plugin-datalabels,
  canvas-gauges, Day.js (+utc/timezone), qrcode, marked, chroma.js, SVG.js, and Phosphor icons
  (`<i class="ph-bold ph-heart">`, font inlined as a `data:` URL). Isolation is unchanged (opaque
  origin, no network); verified end to end that each renders through the real compose path. The
  canvas editor's code popout now **auto-formats** on open (js-beautify) so one-line / MCP-authored
  code is readable, with a Format button and line-wrapping; and the sidebars are now **resizable**
  (drag handles, persisted) and scroll when content overflows. The MCP bridge doc-shape (0.5.6)
  documents every sandbox library with usage, and `set_canvas_background` now tells agents the
  fal.ai key lives on the AI-image (fal-image) widget.

### Changed

- **A device can switch frame format (png <-> bmp) without re-registering.** Re-declaring
  `format` on a later `POST /api/v1/device/register` or `/discover` (MAC-match) now moves an
  already-registered device to the matching renderer in place, instead of the declared format
  being silently ignored on any existing device. On a real switch the device's cached frame is
  invalidated, so `GET /frame` returns `204` until the next push repaints it in the new format,
  rather than serving the stale old-format frame (previously only clearable by deleting
  `data/core/renders`). A `format` that's absent, unknown, or already active is a no-op.

- **CircuitPython BMP frames are 2-8x smaller (sub-byte packing).** The `circuitpython_bmp`
  renderer now packs the indexed frame at the smallest standard BMP bit depth that fits its
  palette (a bespoke writer in `app.bmp_writer`): 1 bpp for mono, 4 bpp for tri-colour / 4-grey /
  Spectra 6 / 7-colour ACeP, versus Pillow's fixed 8-bit. Output stays uncompressed BI_RGB and
  decodes on the same `adafruit_imageload` path (its unpacker is generic over bit depth); the
  full-colour rgb24/rgb16 passthrough still emits a 24-bit BMP. The palette compacts to the colours
  actually present, so a frame that touches few colours packs even smaller.

### Added

- **Chart.js in code elements; MCP data-source guidance.** Chart.js (vendored, self-hosted) is
  preloaded inside the `code` element's sandbox as `window.Chart` (animations off), so author JS can
  draw charts from widget data with a `<canvas>` and `new Chart(...)`. It's inlined into the
  network-blocked opaque-origin sandbox, so the isolation is unchanged; it renders once at compose
  time (verified end to end through the real render path). The MCP bridge doc-shape (0.5.5) gains a
  "DATA SOURCES" section spelling out the model (a source is always a widget key + options; `data`
  and `bind` take one, `code` takes many named ones as `ctx.data.<name>`; probe first; shared fetch
  is free) and documents the Chart.js availability.

- **Code elements take data from any number of widgets; canvas editor gains collapsible
  sidebars and a CodeMirror popout.** A `code` element now declares a list of named `sources`
  (`{key, options, name}`), each injected as `ctx.data.<name>`, so one element's JS can combine
  weather + transit + calendar, etc. (a legacy single `source` still works, keyed by widget id).
  Drivable from MCP with no new endpoint (the `sources` array rides `add_element`/`set_canvas`;
  bridge doc-shape updated, 0.5.4). In the canvas editor, the left and right sidebars now collapse
  to reclaim canvas space (persisted per browser), and code is authored in a rich CodeMirror popout
  (vendored, self-hosted; HTML/CSS/JS panes with syntax highlighting, line numbers, bracket matching)
  opened from the element inspector, which also lists each source's `ctx.data.<name>.<path>` fields.

- **Canvas `code` element: HTML/CSS/JS fed by widget data.** A new canvas element kind runs
  author HTML + CSS + JavaScript, fed by a widget's live data primitive: the source widget's
  fetched data is injected as the JS global `ctx.data` (plus `ctx.options`/`ctx.w`/`ctx.h`) and the
  JS builds the DOM from it. It renders in a sandboxed iframe with scripts enabled but an opaque
  origin and CSP `default-src 'none'` — no network, no same-origin access — so the data is delivered
  (never fetched from inside the frame) and the loopback render context stays sealed. Runs once at
  render (e-ink is static). Authored in the canvas editor (source picker + HTML/CSS/JS panes with a
  `ctx.data` field hint) and drivable from MCP with no new endpoint: `kind` is a free field, so
  `add_element` / `set_canvas` carry it, and `probe_widget_data` surfaces the field shape first.
  Bridge doc-shape documents the kind (bumped to 0.5.3).

- **AI-generated canvas backgrounds (fal.ai).** A canvas dashboard can generate a full-bleed
  background image from a text prompt; the data widgets composite crisply on top, so the data
  never passes through the image model (the background is decorative, the numbers stay exact).
  New `app.fal_backgrounds` service calls fal.ai, stores the result as a local render asset, and
  sets the canvas' existing `bg_image`. Exposed as `POST /api/mcp/pages/<id>/background` (and
  `set_canvas_background` in the `tesserae-mcp` bridge) and as a "Generate background" control in
  the canvas editor's appearance panel. Model + style presets mirror the fal-image widget; the
  fal key is reused from an installed fal-image widget, else `app.fal.api_key`, else `FAL_KEY`.
  Generation is on-demand (set-and-forget). Needs a fal.ai key; no key = the feature 400s cleanly.

- **MCP faithful-render screenshots for the catalog (Screenshot Contract).** The
  `GET /api/mcp/widgets/<id>/render.png` faithful render now accepts explicit `w`&`h`
  (clamped) as an alternative to `size` (`lg` stays 1200x800), reuses the same
  Playwright render path, and tightens its error semantics to the contract: unknown
  widget 404, unknown fragment or invalid `options`/`opts` JSON 400, render unavailable
  503 (was 502), never a 200 with a blank / HTML body. A small `python -m app.screenshots
  <id> --out <dir> --lg --extra <presets.json>` CLI drives that same endpoint to write a
  widget's whole catalog set (`lg.png` plus `extra-1..N.png` from a `{name, options}`
  preset list). All additive; no `w`/`h` = today's behaviour.

- **CircuitPython clients can request an uncompressed BMP frame.** New
  `circuitpython_bmp` renderer emits the composition quantised to the panel's palette
  as an uncompressed indexed BMP, alongside the existing `circuitpython_png`. A client
  declares `"format": "bmp"` on `/discover` (or `/register`) to bind it. The BMP needs
  no `zlib.decompress` on the client: `adafruit_imageload` reads it row by row, so peak
  RAM is the framebuffer plus a small row buffer, where an indexed PNG's one-shot inflate
  can't fit a contiguous decode buffer on Pico W class boards. PNG stays the default for
  boards with headroom (it's a few times smaller on the wire). The `circuitpython_generic`
  kind now lists both renderers and pins one per instance via a `renderer_id` recorded at
  registration; the shared pixel pipeline lives in `app.quantizer` so both formats produce
  identical pixels. Spec: [client protocol](https://dmellok.github.io/tesserae/dev/client-protocol/).

- **MCP: less friction authoring widgets via Studio.** Three additions to the
  `/api/mcp` surface: `GET /widgets/<id>/render.png` takes a `fragment` param so an
  agent can faithfully render a single declared fragment (not just the whole card),
  400ing an unknown fragment id; `render.png` and `POST /widgets/<id>/data` take
  `fresh=true` to bypass caches (surfaced to widgets as `ctx["fresh"]`, and it skips
  the render path's last-good fallback) so a just-edited `server.py` is instantly
  verifiable; and `DELETE /api/mcp/pages/<id>` removes a canvas dashboard (throwaway QA
  pages), exposed in the `tesserae-mcp` bridge as `delete_canvas_page`. The reload acks
  now carry `reloaded` (and a re-imported module count) so an agent can tell a real
  in-process reload from a no-op. All additive; no `fragment`/`fresh` = today's behaviour.

### Changed

- **The `tesserae-mcp` bridge now lives in this repo** (`packages/tesserae-mcp`) as a
  self-contained sub-project with its own `pyproject`, so its tool list / doc-shape stay
  in lockstep with the `/api/mcp` surface it wraps and are tested in the same CI run. It
  still ships a thin, stdlib-plus-`mcp` wheel published to PyPI as `tesserae-mcp`, so an
  agent-machine install stays light. Install becomes `pip install tesserae-mcp`.

### Docs

- The `tesserae-studio-mcp` bridge install now reads `pip install tesserae-studio-mcp`
  (it's on PyPI), matching the `tesserae-mcp` section, with a from-source fallback.

- MCP client-config snippets for Codex CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, VS Code, and the
  OpenAI Agents SDK, alongside the existing Claude config.

- Two new docs-site pages: **Build widgets with Studio** (the Tesserae Studio authoring
  loop, linter rules, and the new-widget restart gate) and **MCP servers: install & use**
  (installing and configuring both `tesserae-mcp` for dashboards and `tesserae-studio-mcp`
  for widgets).

### Added

- **Canvas: live data bindings for shapes.** Data elements re-evaluate every render,
  which is why numbers stay live; shapes (rect / ellipse / icon / line / text) were
  static geometry. Any element can now carry `bind` entries that read a widget field
  each render and map it through a transform to patch the element's props, so a shape
  reflects data in lockstep with the data primitives on the same canvas, with no
  polling or agent tick, and it survives push / rotation. Six transforms: `position`
  (a marker that moves along a segment), `length` (a gauge that grows), `pick` (hop
  between discrete states by index), `color` (threshold colouring), `gradient` (a
  value interpolated smoothly along colour stops, quantised to the panel palette on
  e-ink), and `icon` (a condition code to a Phosphor glyph). Bindings resolve through
  the same shared fetch as data elements, so a shape bound to a widget already on the
  canvas costs no extra request. Authored via the document (MCP `set_canvas` /
  `tesserae-mcp` 0.4.0); a binding that can't resolve is skipped, leaving the element's
  authored props intact.

- **MCP: push a widget you are authoring to a running instance.** New endpoints let
  an authoring client (Tesserae Studio) install a widget over the network with no
  shared filesystem, so authoring works against a Tesserae on another machine or in
  the Home Assistant App / Docker. `POST /api/mcp/widgets/install` accepts a widget
  tarball, validates it (kind widget, schema-valid, no bundled-id collision, tar-slip
  and size guarded), writes it to a persistent `authored/` dir, and reloads: an
  in-process registry rebuild when safe (fast, no dropped connections) or a process
  restart when the widget adds an admin page. `DELETE /api/mcp/widgets/<id>`,
  `POST /api/mcp/reload`, `GET /api/mcp/widgets?origin=authored`, and a faithful
  `GET /api/mcp/widgets/<id>/render.png` round it out. Token-authed like the rest of
  the MCP surface (loopback or bearer), behind the `mcp` experiment.

- **MCP: faithful, editable, hardware-aware dashboard building.** A batch of
  agent-facing improvements from real building sessions:
  - **Partial edits.** `update_element`, `delete_element`, and `patch_canvas`
    change one element or one document field without re-sending the whole canvas
    (a big dashboard was expensive and error-prone to edit before).
  - **Structured render report.** `render_report` returns a machine-readable
    companion to the preview PNG: per element, the resolved box, the text that
    rendered, overflow/clip flags, whether the data was live / sample / error, and
    the computed colours, plus the board's resolved background and theme. The agent
    can verify a render (catch clipping, confirm live data) without parsing pixels.
  - **Probe tells live from placeholder.** `probe_widget_data` now reports a
    `data_source` (live | sample | error) and a `reason`, and lists the bindable
    field paths with sample values, so an agent stops mistaking a demo sample for
    a real result and stops reverse-engineering field shapes.
  - **Text measurement + layout helper.** `measure_text` reports how wide text
    renders in a given font (so a box can fit its content and not clip);
    `arrange` computes aligned grid / row / column boxes so an agent lays out by
    intent instead of hand-computing every pixel.
  - **Leaner option schemas.** `get_widget_options` omits huge choice lists (HA
    entity pickers) by default, showing a count and a `choices` endpoint; each
    option carries a format hint for its type. `get_widget_choices` pages the rows.
  - **Device colour capability.** `list_devices` now reports each panel's
    `color_mode`, renderable palette (hex), and a `mono` flag, so an agent designs
    within what the hardware can show.
  - **Concurrent-edit guard.** Writes accept a `base_rev` (from `get_canvas`); if
    the page changed since, the write returns a conflict instead of clobbering a UI
    edit, and acks now carry `updated_at` / `updated_by`.

  Requires the `tesserae-mcp` bridge 0.3.0.

- **Canvas editor: SVG primitive.** Paste raw SVG as an element; it scales to fill
  the box and renders in a sandboxed iframe.

- **Data primitives: value formatting.** A `format` option renders datetimes and
  numbers (e.g. `HH:mm`, `MMM d`, `relative`, `0.0`), so calendar/time fields are
  presentable. Field paths also gain array indexing and a pluck syntax
  (`series.*.total` / `series[].total`) to feed charts from arrays of objects.

- **MCP: agent affordances.** From feedback building dashboards with an agent:
  `set_canvas` returns a compact `{ok,id,rev,elements}` ack instead of echoing the
  whole document (opt back in with `?return=doc`); a `probe_widget_data` tool
  returns a widget's live data so the agent can see real field names before
  binding; an `add_element` tool appends one element per call (each a save, so an
  open editor updates live as the agent builds); and the catalog omits per-widget
  samples to stay small.

### Fixed

- **Pushed widgets served their assets only after a restart.** A widget installed
  over the MCP push path went live for data on the in-process reload but its
  `client.js` / static assets kept 404ing until a full restart, so a freshly pushed
  widget rendered blank. The per-plugin asset routes closed over the registry captured
  at startup; they now read `app.config["PLUGIN_REGISTRY"]` fresh per request (matching
  the composer / condition routes), so a newly-pushed non-blueprint widget serves its
  assets immediately on reload. Widgets that declare an admin `blueprint()` still take
  one restart (Flask registers blueprints once at startup).

- **MCP `render.png` returned a login screenshot on password-protected instances.**
  The single-widget render endpoint screenshots `/_test/render` over loopback with no
  session; that path was not in the auth gate's loopback-exempt list, so a
  password-protected instance redirected the render to `/login` and captured the login
  page instead of the widget. `/_test/render` is now loopback-exempt (loopback only,
  same trust boundary as `/compose`), so the render is faithful with or without a
  password.

- **Grid layout editor: smooth edge dragging.** Dragging a cell edge no longer
  rebuilds the whole schematic board on every pointer move; it repositions just
  the affected cells (coalesced per animation frame), so the drag tracks at full
  frame rate. The live preview follows the drag in place instead of sitting still
  until release, and settles authoritatively when the drag ends.

- **Weather widgets: a written-out location now resolves.** A location set as
  plain text (e.g. by an MCP agent, or `"South Morang"` / `"Paris, FR"` /
  `"-37.65,145.09"`) is geocoded server-side instead of being ignored, so the
  preview and the pushed frame both show weather for that place and echo its
  name. Preview and push share one resolver, so they can no longer disagree. A
  location that genuinely can't be resolved now surfaces an error for the place
  you asked for rather than silently falling back to the sample city.

- **Canvas: one fetch per widget.** Several data primitives bound to the same
  widget (temperature, humidity, wind off one weather source) now share a single
  data fetch per render instead of each fetching independently.

- **Canvas theme background.** The editor and the pushed frame disagreed on an
  unset background (one showed black), and neither loaded user / community theme
  CSS the grid pages resolve; both now agree and fall back to the theme paper
  colour.

- **Canvas editor: external swaps remount cleanly.** When the open document is
  replaced by an external save, the editor now forces a full remount so stale
  element nodes can't linger.

- **Canvas editor: layer names.** Decoration, data, and custom-HTML/SVG elements
  showed as "Empty" in the Layers panel; they now carry meaningful names.

- **Canvas editor: icon key format.** The icon primitive now accepts both `star`
  and `ph-star` (matching the format widget icon fields use).

- **Canvas editor: data primitives.** A new element that binds any widget's data
  field (by dotted path) to a scalable text, number, or graph (line / bar /
  sparkline via Chart.js). Pick a source widget, configure it, choose a field
  from the introspected data, and style it. Renders identically in the editor
  and the pushed frame.

- **Canvas editor: custom HTML element.** Author a "mini widget" from HTML + CSS,
  rendered in a sandboxed iframe (no scripts, no network). Set it in the editor
  or over MCP.

- **Canvas editor: partially off-canvas elements.** Elements may sit past the
  panel edge (they clip cleanly at render), keeping a sliver on-canvas so they
  stay grabbable.

- **Canvas editor: Shift to keep aspect ratio.** Hold Shift while dragging a
  corner handle to resize proportionally.

- **Live canvas updates in the editor.** The freeform canvas editor now reflects
  external saves without a reload, so you can watch an MCP agent build a
  dashboard in real time. It follows changes silently while you're not editing;
  if you have unsaved local edits it shows a non-destructive "changed externally"
  reload prompt instead of clobbering them. Backed by a per-canvas Server-Sent
  Events stream and a content rev that distinguishes your own saves from
  external ones.

- **MCP server (build dashboards with AI).** An optional Model Context Protocol
  server lets an agent (Claude Desktop / Claude Code, etc.) build freeform canvas
  dashboards: it lists your widgets and devices, lays out a canvas, renders a
  preview to check its work, and pushes to a panel. Enable it under **Settings →
  System → MCP** (off by default), then run the
  [`tesserae-mcp`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-mcp) bridge on your agent's
  machine. The `/api/mcp` surface is reachable from loopback without a token, or
  with a generated token for a remote agent; writes only touch canvas dashboards,
  pushing is always explicit, and agent-created pages are flagged in the
  Dashboards list. The stdio bridge is a separate package (installed where the
  agent runs), so Tesserae core stays free of the `mcp` dependency. See the docs.

- **Dark mode in the canvas editor.** The freeform canvas editor, a standalone
  page that doesn't extend the admin shell, now follows the shell's persisted
  light/dark choice (applied before paint, so no flash) and carries its own
  toolbar toggle. Its overlays (the experimental disclaimer and small-screen
  block-out) go dark with it.

- **Canvas editor guardrails.** The freeform canvas editor gains an explicit
  Save button (also Cmd/Ctrl+S) and a back-to-dashboards link in its toolbar,
  a first-open notice that the editor is experimental with a link to file bug
  reports, and a small-screen block-out that explains phone editing is not
  supported and offers a way back.

### Changed

- **Removed the usage survey** from Settings → About. The aggregate heartbeat
  now covers the "how is Tesserae used" question the survey stood in for.

### Fixed

- **Dark-mode gaps across the admin UI.** Swept hardcoded light colours onto
  the shared token palette so they adapt in dark mode: the Devices card palette
  (previously light in both themes), Settings chips / segmented controls /
  hint and warning bands, and page ledes. The always-dark save bar keeps light
  text in both themes.

- **Create-dashboard button sat low.** The button on the Dashboards create row
  now centres with the name field and layout picker instead of hugging the
  bottom edge.

- **First-run consent step could be skipped.** The online-features opt-in ran
  after the dashboard step, whose Edit and freeform actions hand off to the
  editor and let someone leave the wizard before the consent screen was ever
  shown. It now runs before the dashboard step, which becomes the final Finish.

- **Online features toggle showed a raw checkbox** beside the styled switch.
  The form now carries `field--switch`, which scopes the checkbox-hide CSS, so
  only the switch renders.

### Added

- **Online features (opt-in, asked at first-run).** Tesserae can report an
  anonymous, aggregate install count to `api.tesserae.ink` when you add a
  widget from the marketplace, and show the count on the Browse cards. Each
  request may include your install's random ID, the widget id, and the
  running version; a coarse country is derived from the request IP and
  the IP is then discarded. No account, no personal data, no IP addresses
  or User-Agent strings are stored. **It is off by default**: the first-run
  wizard asks once, and a single switch at **Settings → System → Online
  features** governs it and the app + device-firmware update checks.
  Leaving it off means the app never contacts `api.tesserae.ink`. This
  replaces the separate firmware-update opt-in. Never enabled in CI /
  Codespaces / dev containers. Install pings surface on the `/events`
  timeline under the telemetry filter.

- **Daily heartbeat.** With Online features on, Tesserae sends a once-a-day
  best-effort heartbeat to `api.tesserae.ink` carrying only low-cardinality,
  aggregate facts about the install (version, OS family, CPU arch, Python
  minor, deployment kind, transport, a bucketed device count, the set of
  registered device kinds, and a Home Assistant boolean). The server stores
  only the day, not a timestamp, and dedupes to one per install per day, so
  the cadence can't become an activity trace. No personal data, no exact
  counts, no IP stored. Also gated by **Settings → System → Online features**;
  the payload is documented on the privacy page.

### Fixed

- **Reordered multi-select entries survive a save.** The editor's
  multi-select picker (Home Assistant entities / sensors) rendered its
  options in the plugin's default ``choices()`` order and only toggled
  which were checked, so a drag-reordered selection was never redrawn in
  the saved order. Saving any cell rewrites every cell's form, so an
  unrelated change like switching the dashboard theme re-submitted the
  entities in the default order and wiped the arrangement. The picker
  now renders checked options first, in the saved order, then the rest,
  so the order round-trips. (#94)

- **Unbound dashboard no longer leaks onto a bound device's panel.**
  Sending a dashboard bound to no device fanned out to every renderer,
  including the per-device clone renderers of devices bound to other
  dashboards. That overwrote the bound device's latest-render entry, so
  the device painted the unbound dashboard on its next
  ``/api/v1/device/<id>/frame`` poll. Hard to catch because it only
  showed if the client happened to poll in the small window after the
  unbound push. Unbound / virtual-panel pushes now skip per-device
  clone renderers; only base renderers fan out (legacy single-head /
  retained MQTT topic still works). Bound devices only ever receive
  frames from pushes that target them (#83).

## [0.72.0], 2026-07-08

### Added

- **PicPak 4.2" BWRY as a community-firmware hardware entry.** New
  hardware SKU manifest at `hardware/community/picpak_4_2.json`, a
  featured hardware page at `docs/hardware/picpak.md`, and a
  Community vendor bucket in the compatibility matrix. Links back to
  the community firmware at `varanu5/picpak-tesserae-client`; credit
  sits on the firmware repo. The `picpak_client` device kind already
  ships with Tesserae; this surfaces it in Settings → Add Device and
  in the browsable compatibility docs.
- **Tri-colour and greyscale gamuts for the CircuitPython PNG path.** New
  panel gamut values `bwr_3` (black/white/red tri-colour e-ink) and
  `gray_4` (4-level greyscale ramp) join `bwry_4` in the 2-bit family. A
  client can declare either over `/discover`, and the `circuitpython_png`
  renderer quantises to the matching indexed palette so `adafruit_imageload`
  mounts it directly with no on-device quantise.

### Fixed

- **Calibration tone & dither block no longer disappears after save on a
  device whose id matches a base renderer prefix.** `_drop_clones`
  removed every renderer whose `device` matched the instance id; for an
  instance literally named `pi_bin` (or `pi_png`, `esp32`, …) that also
  matched the base renderer, so the combined-form save deleted the base
  and left the device with no renderer clones until the next restart.
  The device's Calibration tab then rendered no picture-quality fields.
  `_drop_clones` now only removes clone records (`<base>__<instance>`),
  never a base renderer (#52).
- **Panel gamut / calibration changes now repaint instead of serving a
  stale 304.** The content-checksum skip keyed only on the composition
  digest, so switching a device's panel (e.g. Spectra 6 to ACeP),
  editing a calibration profile, or changing saturation/contrast/dither
  left the device on the previous palette's frame until the dashboard
  pixels themselves changed. The skip now compares a full render
  signature (composition + panel geometry/gamut + resolved renderer
  settings), so any input that alters the packed bytes triggers a fresh
  render (#81).
- **Status bar update chip no longer fires against an older release.**
  The ``tesserae_status`` widget trusted ``api.tesserae.ink``'s
  ``is_current`` flag, so callers running an edge / local build ahead
  of the latest published release surfaced a ghost "update pending"
  chip pointing back at the older version. Client now compares
  ``latest`` to ``current`` on the leading numeric triplet and only
  paints the chip when the latest release is strictly newer.
- **Status bar rate-limits its update check.** The version-check fetch
  fired on every render (each dashboard push), hammering
  ``api.tesserae.ink`` for the same answer. The widget now caches the
  most recent response in ``localStorage`` for 1 hour, keyed by
  channel + current version, so at most one fetch per hour per browser
  session. The cache invalidates automatically on app upgrade because
  the current-version key changes.

### Changed

- **Update chips lead with the new version.** The ``tesserae_status``
  server-version chip previously showed the RUNNING version with a
  small "-> .N" hint at the newer patch. It now leads with the new
  version ("v0.71.5 available") and pairs both server and firmware
  chips with a ``ph-download-simple`` icon so the two read as one
  consistent "there is something to install" signal.
- **Status bar honours the page gap on all four sides.** The
  ``tesserae_status`` widget was declared ``full_bleed=true`` so it
  rendered edge-to-edge on the wall-touching sides; users expected the
  gap slider's matting to be visible around the bar on all sides,
  not just the edge shared with the widgets below. Removed
  ``full_bleed`` from the manifest so the composer applies normal
  gap padding, and grew the auto-inserted bar cell's height by
  ``outer_pad + inner_pad`` at toggle-on time so the visible content
  area stays at the design's 48 px regardless of the current page
  gap. Existing installs with a status bar cell inserted before
  this fix keep the older 48 px cell; toggling the switch off and
  back on re-sizes to the new gap-aware height.
- **Status-bar toggle in the page editor is flat, not a disclosure.**
  The section previously wrapped its "Enabled / Disabled" switch in a
  ``<details>`` shell so the body panel could expand and collapse. The
  body is a one-liner of help text plus (when enabled) a jump link, so
  the expand animation revealed essentially nothing and read as broken.
  Header row now sits above a fixed body panel; no expand/collapse
  state to persist. The switch itself is now a proper track+thumb
  toggle (was rendering as a bare checkbox before).
- **Auto-insert status bar cell defaults ``check_for_updates`` to on.**
  Enabling the status bar is an implicit opt-in to the update-indicator
  chip; the fetch is rate-limited to once per hour and only paints
  when the latest release is strictly newer than the running build.
- **"Enable firmware update lookups" toggle rendered as a proper switch.**
  Previously the input's label styled as a switch but the track+thumb
  spans were missing, so the control rendered as a bare checkbox with
  text. Now matches the pattern used everywhere else.

### Fixed (continued)

- **Install-identifier and firmware-check sections in Settings → System
  no longer float with a gap above.** The ``settings-stack`` wrapping
  div closed BEFORE those two sections, so they inherited none of the
  stack's spacing rules. Closed the wrapper after the firmware-check
  block so they sit inside the stack.

### Removed

- **"Tesserae account" reference in the install-identifier
  description.** There is no such thing as a Tesserae account; the copy
  read "Not tied to your identity, hardware, or Tesserae account". Now
  reads "Not tied to your identity or hardware."

## [0.71.2], 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Full-bleed cells now honour the gap between neighbouring cells.**
  v0.71.1's ``render.full_bleed`` handling skipped padding entirely,
  which made the status bar sit flush against the widgets below it
  (no visible matting even at large gap settings). Full-bleed now
  only drops the outer padding (edges touching the panel wall);
  inner padding between the cell and its neighbours still applies,
  so the gap slider stays visible around the bar.
- **Palette / tone editor no longer disappears from the Calibration
  tab after a save (issue #52 follow-up).** The section is gated on
  ``palette_profile_slug`` resolving to a real profile; if the slug
  got into a state where it pointed at nothing (fresh install with no
  applied profile, or a stale slug from a deleted user profile), the
  whole palette + tone block vanished from the DOM. ``_palette_profile_slug_for``
  now self-heals: on any read where the device has a supported
  gamut (Spectra 6 or Inky 7-colour) and the stored slug is empty or
  unresolvable, it backfills the family's default bundled slug and
  persists it. Devices whose gamut has no matching family (mono,
  bwry_4, rgb24, rgb16) are still passed through untouched.
- **Manual re-add after device delete now wipes leftover state
  (issue #48 follow-up).** The discovery path already wiped orphan
  state on a MAC-differs signal, but the manual "Add device" form has
  no MAC to compare, so re-adding a device under the same id kept
  dashboards / history / per-device settings from the previous
  instance. ``devices_add`` now looks up the delete-marker for the
  target id and, when one exists, calls ``wipe_orphan_state`` before
  creating the new instance so the new device starts pristine.

### Changed

- **History status label renamed "delivered" → "pushed" (discussion
  #62).** The chip on the History timeline reflected the server-
  side ``sent`` status, but "delivered" implied end-to-end receipt.
  The push pipeline only guarantees a successful publish (broker
  publish, or a REST device with a new digest ready to poll); it
  doesn't know whether the panel has applied the frame yet.
  Renamed to "pushed" so the chip matches the guarantee. Separate
  receipt tracking is a follow-up.
- **OpenAPI spec version bumped to match the release (discussion
  #28).** ``schema/openapi.yaml`` had ``info.version`` stuck at
  0.64.16. Rolled to the current version so generated SDKs carry the
  right release marker.

### Added

- **Per-cell padding override (feedback from r/eink launch DMs).**
  Each cell now has an optional ``padding_override`` field surfaced
  in the page editor as a **Layout tweaks** disclosure (collapsed by
  default so the cell edit card stays lean). Ticking "Override
  page-gap padding for this cell" turns on a 0-80 px slider whose
  value replaces the page-level gap-derived padding on that cell,
  and also beats the widget's ``render.full_bleed`` manifest flag,
  so users can dial in per-widget breathing room without touching
  the page gap the other cells share.
- **Content-checksum push skip (feedback from r/eink launch DMs).**
  When the newly-rendered composition PNG matches a bound device's
  last-served digest, the push pipeline no longer publishes to that
  device. The panel isn't asked to re-paint, which is a real battery
  win on the bigger e-ink panels and the primary optimisation
  callers were doing externally (checksumming their own data and
  suppressing the webhook). Skipped renderers surface as
  ``unchanged=True`` on the per-renderer result and log a
  ``no_change`` event. When every bound renderer for a push is
  unchanged, the whole push logs as ``no_change`` too, and the
  History timeline shows a distinct "no change" chip. HTTP-polled
  devices' next fetch still returns 304 via the existing ETag path;
  MQTT-only devices skip the retained re-publish entirely.

## [0.71.1], 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Status bar rendered on the right edge of portrait panels instead
  of at the top.** ``fit_cells_to_panel`` rotates the layout 90°
  clockwise when the design orientation doesn't match the target
  (landscape design ↔ portrait panel), which maps the top edge onto
  the right edge. The status bar cell got rotated along with everything
  else and painted as a vertical strip on the right. The fitter now
  accepts a ``top_strip_index`` hint: the flagged cell is
  orientation-fixed and stays at ``(0, 0, target_w, strip_h_scaled)``
  in the target regardless of rotation; the remaining cells are fitted
  into the below-strip band with the normal rotate + scale rules. Both
  the composer and the "refit to current panel" path pass the hint
  automatically when the page has an auto-managed status bar.
- **Status bar swallowed by the gap slider.** When the user set a
  larger matting gap, the composer's outer padding ate into the
  48 px bar cell, leaving very little for the widget content. The
  ``render.full_bleed`` manifest flag (previously captured but not
  applied) now actually skips the padding subtraction, and the
  ``tesserae_status`` plugin declares it. The bar renders edge-to-
  edge regardless of the gap slider's value; other widgets are
  unchanged.
- **Disabling the status bar left a strip of matting at the top.**
  The reverse-rescale on toggle-off only undid the shift + scale
  applied when enabling, which meant any layout edits made while the
  bar was on could leave a gap. Toggle-off now refits the remaining
  cells to the full panel via ``fit_cells_to_panel``, so the vacated
  band is absorbed proportionally by the widgets that are left.

## [0.71.0], 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Page-level status bar toggle.** The dashboard editor now has a
  "Status bar" section below the corner-radius slider. Flip the
  switch and Tesserae auto-inserts a full-width 48 px
  ``tesserae_status`` cell at the top of the layout; existing cells
  shift down and rescale proportionally to fit the remaining space.
  Flipping it back off removes the bar and reverses the rescale so
  the layout returns to its pre-toggle shape. Switching layout
  presets while the bar is on preserves it at row 0 rather than
  remapping it into the preset's first slot. Always horizontal at
  the top regardless of panel orientation.

### Fixed

- **Status bar widget: icons now render on the compose canvas.**
  Phosphor's ``.ph-bold`` class rules live in the compose document,
  which the shadow root doesn't inherit, so the chip icons were
  rendering as blank squares. The widget now links
  ``/static/style/spectra-widgets.css`` into its shadow root, same
  pattern the weather widgets use.
- **Status bar widget: text scales with the cell.** Font sizes are
  now driven by container-query height units (``cqh``) with clamps at
  each end, so a 48 px bar and a 400 px cell both render at the right
  weight instead of shrinking to 12 px everywhere.

### Removed

- **Status bar widget: weather chip and the two custom text slots
  dropped.** Weather was misleading in a widget that has no live
  weather source of its own; the custom slots duplicated existing
  widgets. If you were relying on either, drop a
  ``weather_now`` widget or a small text widget onto the dashboard
  directly.

## [0.70.1], 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- **Device firmware-check lookups are now opt-in and off by default.**
  v0.70.0 shipped the Devices-card firmware chip and the
  ``tesserae_status`` firmware-updates chip wired directly to
  ``api.tesserae.ink/firmware/<kind>/latest`` on first render.
  Functionally a default-on outbound call, which contradicts the
  "app itself sends no phone-home telemetry" claim. New setting
  ``settings.app.check_firmware_updates`` (default ``false``) gates
  both call sites; enable it from Settings -> System -> "Check for
  device firmware updates". When off, the Devices card still shows
  the current firmware from each device's heartbeat but the "update
  available" pill never fires, and the widget's firmware-updates
  chip stays hidden. Only the device kind name is ever sent; no
  install identifier, no device-specific fields.

## [0.70.0], 2026-07-07

### Added

- **`install_id` foundation for shared-world widgets.** Tesserae now
  generates a random UUID on first startup and persists it at
  ``data/core/install_id.json``. Widgets that declare
  ``needs_install_id`` in their manifest receive the raw value on
  ``ctx``, which is what upcoming shared-world features (dashboard pet,
  traveler) will key against so state survives restarts. Widgets that
  declare ``needs_scoped_id`` receive
  ``SHA-256(install_id + plugin_id)`` instead, so their outbound
  calls can't be correlated with other widgets on the same install.
  The identifier is regenerable from **Settings → System → Install
  identifier**; regeneration resets any per-install state that
  external widget services have accumulated.
- **Device firmware chip on the Devices card.** Each registered device
  kind is looked up against ``api.tesserae.ink/firmware/<kind>/latest``
  the first time the Devices page renders (and on demand every 60 min
  after). When the device's running firmware is behind, an amber
  "update available" pill appears next to the version. Lookups are
  cached, silent-fail on network error, and the only outbound data is
  the kind name.
- **`tesserae_status` bundled widget (fixes #66).** Dashboard status
  strip. Left identity (dashboard name + optional leading icon) paired
  with a right-hand row of ambient chips: time, weather, panel
  battery, Wi-Fi, broker, plus conditional app-version and firmware
  update indicators, plus two custom text slots. Two placements (bar,
  48 px tall; block, resizable, wrapping chips) and three chip modes
  (icon+text, icon-only, text-only). Auto-contrasts against a
  freeform ``panelBg`` hex: text, icons, and rules flip between ink
  (#1B1A16) and paper (#FCFBF7) based on background luminance, and
  the update accent flips between two reds. Update chips render only
  when an update is pending; the signal is a positional badge dot on
  the icon or an accent-red text sub, never colour alone, so a 1-bit
  render still reads the update. The app-version update check is
  off by default; when enabled it fetches
  ``api.tesserae.ink/version/latest`` with a widget-scoped install id
  (see above).
- **Auto-release workflow.** Pushing a ``v*`` tag now creates the
  matching GitHub Release from ``CHANGELOG.md`` automatically. Every
  release is marked ``--latest`` so ``api.tesserae.ink/version/latest``
  picks it up on the next poll. Existing Releases are never overwritten.

### Fixed

- **Broker-less installs no longer log push failures for renderers
  that never had a broker to publish to (issue #67).** ``_fan_out``
  walks every registered renderer, so on a
  REST-only fleet with no MQTT configured, base kind renderers
  (esp32_bin, esp32_bw_bin, pi_png, etc.) still called
  ``transport.publish`` and got back
  ``RuntimeError("transport not connected")``. The exception marked
  the whole render as failed in the history view even though the
  actually-bound REST device published fine. ``MqttTransport.publish``
  now silently no-ops when the host was empty at construction; when a
  host was configured but the connection dropped, it still raises so
  a genuine outage still surfaces.

### Changed

- **Privacy docs updated.** ``docs/privacy.md`` documents the new
  install identifier, both places widgets can fetch from
  ``api.tesserae.ink``, and the exact query parameters those calls
  carry. The app itself still sends no phone-home telemetry.

## [0.69.18], 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **PicPak 4.2" BWRY panels no longer paint upside-down and mirrored
  (issue #65, hardware validation and diagnosis by @varanu5).** The
  ``panel.vflip`` opt-in that shipped in v0.69.16 was declared on the
  ``picpak_client`` manifest and honoured by the ``esp32_bin`` renderer,
  but silently dropped by three separate panel-key allow-lists on the
  way from the manifest to the renderer (``device_loader``'s panel
  property, ``panel.device_panel()``, and ``push._panel_dims_for_send``).
  Each layer copied ``w``, ``h``, ``flip``, ``gamut`` etc. but not
  ``vflip``, so ``panel.vflip`` was always ``False`` when the renderer
  checked it and the row-reverse never fired. Three one-line additions
  carry the flag through end to end; a regression test now pins the
  flow so it can't drop again. Existing PicPak installs need to re-add
  the device once so the fixed manifest allow-list writes ``vflip:
  true`` into the instance file.

## [0.69.17], 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- **Sticky save bar no longer paints as a full-height black column on
  the Settings page (issue #52).** The server-tab save-bar variant is
  ``position: fixed`` and specifies ``bottom`` only, but was inheriting
  the sticky device-card variant's ``top`` too. ``top`` + ``bottom`` on
  a fixed element stretches it to fill the viewport height between the
  two insets; content sat at the bottom edge and the empty container
  above it read as one big black rectangle. Added ``top: auto`` on the
  server variant so only ``bottom`` positions it.
- **Saving from the General or Calibration tab no longer jumps back to
  Status (issue #52).** The v0.69.14 tab-scoping fix only threaded
  ``?tab=`` through the calibration-side redirects; the combined-form
  save (General tab, panel dims, quiet hours, etc.) dropped it, so the
  redirect landed with just ``?opened=`` and the template's tab picker
  fell through to the default. Now carries an ``_active_tab`` hidden
  field on the combined form and echoes it back through the redirect.
- **Push history rows no longer contaminate old entries with
  currently-linked devices (issue #52).** The device-chip renderer
  used to fall back to the page's live ``device_ids`` list when the
  event's snapshot was missing, so a device added yesterday would
  appear on entries pushed a week ago (before the device even
  existed). Snapshot-only now; pre-v0.5x rows without a snapshot show
  no chip rather than a wrong one.
- **Per-cell widget options survive a widget-type change (issue #52
  follow-up).** Switching a cell from Weather Now to Weather Forecast
  used to wipe every override, including the location the user had
  set on the previous variant. Now preserves any option whose name is
  also declared on the new plugin's ``cell_options`` schema, so shared
  knobs like ``location`` on weather_* variants (and ``feeds_filter``
  on calendar_* variants) carry through.

### Changed

- **Device cards on Settings → Devices sort alphabetically by name.**
  ``devices().all()`` returned entries in registry insertion order, so
  cards jumped around across renders when devices were added, renamed,
  or re-registered. Now stable, case-insensitive by display name with
  device id as tiebreaker.
- **"Push" button on the Dashboards list names the fan-out.** Was
  labelled "Push" with the tooltip "Push this dashboard to its panel",
  which read as if the button targeted a single device. Now shows
  ``Push to N`` for multi-device dashboards, and the tooltip counts
  the linked devices explicitly.

### Added

- **Push history has a "By dashboard" sort option (issue #52
  follow-up).** ``?sort=dashboard`` groups rows sharing a target so a
  per-dashboard read is one scroll rather than a scan. Default is
  chronological, newest first.
- **``--dev`` mode gains a "Seed dummy devices" affordance.** New
  yellow-bordered card under Add device on Settings → Devices creates
  a set of test instances (``dev_esp32``, ``dev_pi_bin``, ``dev_pi_png``,
  ``dev_picpak``, ``dev_trmnl``) so the device-card UI can be
  reproduced without real hardware attached. Guarded server-side by
  the ``DEV_MODE`` config flag; the button hides and the endpoint
  rejects outside of ``--dev`` mode.

## [0.69.16], 2026-07-06

### Added

- **PicPak 4.2" 4-colour BWRY panel supported out of the box (issue
  #61, firmware and hardware validation by @varanu5).** Ships a bundled
  `picpak_client` device kind that binds to the stock `esp32_bin`
  renderer with `gamut: "bwry_4"` (native 2 bpp packer, already present
  since v0.69.3) and a new `panel.vflip` option for the PicPak's
  bottom-to-top hardware scan direction. PicPak owners can now pair one
  to a stock Tesserae install; no server-plugin needed. Firmware lives
  at [varanu5/picpak-tesserae-client](https://github.com/varanu5/picpak-tesserae-client).

## [0.69.15], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Test-pattern picker keeps its selection across saves.** Every
  calibration-side save (tone, palette colours, custom-image upload)
  returns a 302 to the Calibration tab, and the template's default
  first-radio would win on re-render, dropping whatever pattern the
  user was tuning. The picker's current pattern and colour are now
  persisted in localStorage keyed by device id and restored on load.

## [0.69.14], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Device tabs no longer bleed across cards.** Clicking the Calibration
  tab on one device wrote `?tab=calibration` to the shared URL, so every
  other device card on the page re-rendered with Calibration active on
  the next reload. The template now scopes `?tab=` to the card whose id
  matches `?opened=`; other cards fall back to their default (Status).
- **Custom-image upload keeps the device card expanded.** The upload,
  delete, and Send-to-panel POSTs on the Calibration tab all now thread
  `?opened=<device_id>` through their redirects so the card doesn't
  collapse and lose scroll position on every action. Matches the shape
  the palette / tone routes have used since v0.69.9.
- **Palette-profile picker previews before Apply.** Selecting a
  different profile in the Calibration-tab dropdown now repaints the
  test-pattern preview with that profile's palette and tone straight
  away, instead of waiting for the user to hit Apply. Backed by a new
  `?slug=` query on the preview endpoint (empty string means built-in
  default).
- **BW / grayscale panels no longer show colour-only test patterns.**
  Mono-gamut panels used to see the palette-swatch and solid-fill
  entries in the picker even though both render as two blocks / one
  flat fill. The picker now filters those out for `gamut = "mono"`;
  grayscale ramp, text sample, registration grid, and custom image
  still show. Colour panels are unaffected.

## [0.69.13], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Calendar widgets render dates in the configured app timezone
  (community contribution, #54 by @charmmmz).** The day / week /
  month calendar widgets were computing visible-date boundaries in
  UTC, so users in non-UTC timezones saw the wrong day for events
  near midnight. Now routes through the ``app_timezone()`` helper
  shared with the v0.69.6 history-timestamp fix, and also fixes an
  adjacent bug where multi-day all-day events only bucketed under
  their start date (iCalendar exclusive DTEND semantics are now
  honoured, so a Fri-to-Sun event correctly appears on all three
  days).
- **Cloud-init yamls no longer time-bomb SD cards flashed months later
  (issue #35).** The server cloud-init at
  [`scripts/cloud-init.yaml`](scripts/cloud-init.yaml) used to clone
  ``main`` from ``dmellok/tesserae``, so a user who flashed an SD card
  three months after downloading the yaml got whatever main was on that
  day, not the tested release. Now pins to ``--branch v0.69.13
  --depth 1``. The pi-client cloud-init at
  [`scripts/pi-client-cloud-init.yaml`](scripts/pi-client-cloud-init.yaml)
  gets a shallow clone (``--depth 1``) while the client repo doesn't
  publish tags yet; a comment flags the follow-up to pin properly once
  ``tesserae-device-pi-bin`` cuts its first release.

## [0.69.12], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Multiple sticky save bars now stack instead of overlapping.**
  When both the outer combined-form bar and the tone-form bar are
  dirty on the same device card, they both stick to the viewport
  bottom and previously drew on top of each other. ``settings.js``
  now tracks visible bars via ``MutationObserver`` on the ``hidden``
  attribute and sets a cumulative ``--dx-save-bar-offset`` CSS
  custom property on each, so they stack vertically upwards from
  the viewport bottom (or downwards from the top).
- **``.dx-device-card`` uses ``overflow: clip`` instead of ``hidden``.**
  The ``hidden`` value created a new scrollport scoped to the card,
  which blocked descendant ``position: sticky`` elements (the save
  bars) from sticking to the viewport. ``overflow: clip`` still
  hides overflow past the card's rounded corners but doesn't
  establish a scrollport. Sticky positioning on the bars now uses
  the viewport as intended: the bar sits at its natural position
  when in view, sticks to viewport bottom when scrolled below,
  sticks to viewport top when scrolled above.

## [0.69.11], 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Palette profile picker hides on panels without a matching family.**
  Pre-v0.69.11, the picker fell through to the Spectra 6 default
  family for any unrecognised gamut, so a mono panel, a BWRY panel,
  or an RGB LCD saw Spectra 6 profiles they couldn't apply.
  ``_palette_family_for`` now returns empty for those gamuts and the
  section builder null-gates every palette endpoint (apply, save,
  reset, import, tone editor, per-colour palette editor), so the
  whole Calibration-tab palette section hides for panels that don't
  have bundled profiles. Spectra 6 and Inky 7-colour behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **Sticky save bar sits in-card until it would scroll off.**
  ``position: sticky`` with both ``top`` and ``bottom`` insets so
  the bar sits at its natural in-card position when the natural
  position is in the viewport, and only sticks to the corresponding
  viewport edge when scroll would otherwise carry it off-screen.
  Replaces the v0.69.10 always-fixed variant, which was obscuring
  page content unnecessarily when the natural position was already
  in view. Message now reads "Unsaved changes for &lt;device name&gt;"
  instead of the generic "You have unsaved changes" so users know
  exactly which card is dirty.
- **Palette-tone form gets its own sticky save bar.**
  The v0.69.10 attempt (a sticky footer inside the form with a
  primary teal button and a dirty flag) didn't render right and the
  sticky positioning didn't stick because the form itself is short.
  Replaced with the same ``.dx-save-bar`` shape the outer combined
  form uses, associated to the tone form via ``form=""`` attributes
  on Save + Discard. Reveals when a tone slider is touched, message
  reads "Unsaved tone changes for &lt;device name&gt;".

## [0.69.10], 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Sticky "Save changes" bar now floats at the viewport bottom.**
  Previously it was ``position: sticky`` inside the device card, so a
  long calibration tab could scroll the bar off-screen. Now
  ``position: fixed`` centred at the viewport bottom, with
  ``env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`` inset so the iOS home-indicator
  doesn't sit on top of it. Matches the shape the ``--server``
  variant already used on the Settings > Server section.
- **Palette-tone form's Save button is much more discoverable.**
  The tone form was tall enough that the Save affordance sat below
  the fold when the user was editing sliders at the top; the button
  is now wrapped in a sticky footer inside the form so it stays
  pinned at the bottom of the visible tone-form region, and a small
  "Unsaved tone changes" flag fades in the moment the form goes
  dirty (via a ``data-dirty`` attribute now set by
  ``initDirtyForm``, useful for any future in-form-button dirty
  affordance too). Save button also promoted to the primary teal
  fill so it reads as the action to take.

## [0.69.9], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **Device card save affordance + collapse regressions from v0.68.0.**
  The v0.68.0 device-card reorg placed several per-endpoint forms
  (calibrate, palette, tone, custom-image) inside the outer combined
  form. HTML5 forbids nested forms: the first inner ``</form>`` close
  tag closes the outer form early, orphaning the picture-quality
  fields, the sticky save bar itself, and the Save button. Result:
  ``initDirtyForm`` never wired up (bar wasn't a descendant of the
  form it looked at), the sticky bar stayed hidden, the Save button
  submitted nothing, and changes to Calibration fields quietly did
  not persist. Every per-endpoint palette / tone / calibrate
  redirect also missed ``opened=<id>``, so any Apply on those forms
  collapsed the device card.

  Rewired via the HTML5 ``form="..."`` attribute on every input in
  the tab panels that should submit to the combined endpoint (macros
  in [`_components.html`](templates/_components.html) take a new
  ``form`` parameter); the outer form's id ties the associations
  together regardless of DOM position. Per-endpoint redirects thread
  ``opened=<id>`` via a shared sweep in
  [`palette_routes.py`](app/settings/palette_routes.py) and
  [`devices_routes.py`](app/settings/devices_routes.py) so the card
  stays open across every Save + Apply. Reverts the always-visible
  muted save-bar variant introduced in v0.69.6 (that was a
  workaround for a symptom of this bug; with the form actually wired
  up, hide-until-dirty is the right shape again).

## [0.69.8], 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Live-preview throbber in the widget editor.** The composer
  server-renders the preview page on every change, running each
  widget's ``fetch()`` in parallel; upstreams like Open-Meteo, iCal
  feeds, or Home Assistant add hundreds of ms to seconds of visible
  dead time. A ``ph-circle-notch`` spinner now sits over the faded
  iframe while the reload is in flight, fades in after ~280 ms
  (so a fast render with cached widget data stays flash-free), and
  disappears on the iframe's ``load`` event. Applies to
  ``reloadPreview``, the hourly hard-reset path, and the initial
  page open (which was previously the longest dead time thanks to
  ``loading="lazy"``).

## [0.69.7], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **mypy: narrow legacy lat/lon type in ``_app_location_dict``.**
  v0.69.6 added a legacy-lat/lon migration in
  [`app/composer.py`](app/composer.py) whose ``in (None, "")`` guard
  didn't survive mypy's base type check (the read value is
  ``Any | None``, and mypy sees ``float(None)`` as a type error).
  Explicit ``isinstance`` narrowing against ``int | float | str``
  before the conversion. Behaviour is identical; CI mypy job now
  green.

## [0.69.6], 2026-07-05

Batch fix for issue #52 items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Items 8-10 (Devices
to top-level nav, split registration, admin dashboard) are UX threads
that need their own design pass.

### Fixed

- **Multi-device dashboards now render under every bound device (item 1).**
  The Dashboards list used to pick a "primary" device (the first live
  entry in ``page.device_ids``) and only render the page under that
  section head; a dashboard bound to two devices only surfaced from
  one of them. ``_group_pages_for_index`` in
  [`app/page_routes.py`](app/page_routes.py) now appends the page
  under every live device it's bound to, so each device section head
  owns every dashboard pushed to it. Unbound-device fallback and
  half-deleted-binding tolerance stay intact.
- **History timestamps render in the configured timezone (item 2).**
  [`app/history_routes.py`](app/history_routes.py) was using naive
  ``datetime.fromtimestamp`` which follows the container's TZ (UTC on
  Docker / MicroCloud defaults). Now routes through a new
  ``app_timezone()`` helper in [`app/tz_resolve.py`](app/tz_resolve.py)
  that reads ``settings.app.timezone``, so history rows honour the
  user's zone regardless of what the container thinks it is. Same
  helper is safe to consume from other views that render server-side
  clock times.
- **``for_device`` no longer double-renders on instance-id collisions
  (item 4).** When a user's device instance id equalled a base
  renderer's topic prefix (say, an instance called ``pi_bin`` on a
  ``pi_bin`` base renderer), the settings loop rendered the
  picture-quality block twice with identical ``base_name`` because
  both the base and the clone matched. The registry now filters to
  clones-only when a clone is in the match set, so a single renderer's
  settings appear once regardless of the instance id.
- **Weather widgets fall back to the app-level location (items 5 + 6).**
  New ``Settings → Location & time → Default location`` picker (a
  ``location_search`` field on the same shape the cell-level picker
  uses); ``_resolved_options`` in [`app/composer.py`](app/composer.py)
  splices it into any cell whose own ``location`` dict is empty, so
  weather widgets Just Work after the user picks a global location and
  swapping between weather_now / weather_forecast on a cell no longer
  triggers a re-search. Legacy flat ``latitude`` / ``longitude``
  settings from before v0.69.6 get promoted into the new
  ``{latitude, longitude, name}`` shape on read so upgrades don't
  silently blank the fallback.
- **Sticky "Save changes" bar is always visible on Settings tabs (item 3).**
  Previously hidden until the first ``input`` event, which meant users
  who wanted to save via a persistent button couldn't see one existed.
  The bar now renders in a muted state while the form is clean (dimmed
  background, disabled Save, hidden Discard) and lights up to the
  current styling on the first edit. Applies to the device card, the
  device-kind defaults, and the Settings > Server section. Same JS + CSS
  variant; templates only drop the ``hidden`` attribute and add the
  ``dx-save-bar--muted`` class.
- **beforeunload popup fires only on real edits (item 7).**
  [`static/pages/editor.js`](static/pages/editor.js) used to gate the
  "Leave site?" prompt on ``saveBtn.disabled``, which flipped enabled
  on any ``input`` event including autofill / focus / browser
  extensions, so users saw the prompt while navigating between pages
  they hadn't touched. Now snapshots every form's ``FormData`` on
  load and after each save, and only prompts when the current values
  actually differ from the snapshot.

## [0.69.5], 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- **`esp32_bin` now routes `panel.gamut` through to the packer.** The
  renderer was hardcoding the packer's default (Spectra 6), so a
  device that declared a non-E6 gamut (BWRY, or any future ESP32-side
  gamut) got a Spectra-6 packed frame regardless. `pi_bin` already
  did this correctly, so BWRY on Pi worked but BWRY on ESP32 didn't
  end-to-end until now. See
  [`renderers/esp32_bin/renderer.py`](renderers/esp32_bin/renderer.py).

## [0.69.4], 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **`bwry_4` wire format switched to native 2-bpp packing.** v0.69.3
  shipped BWRY as a 4-bpp nibble-packed buffer (matching Spectra 6 /
  ACeP conventions), which doubled the buffer size a PicPak-class C3
  actually needs and forced a repack step on the client. `bwry_4`
  now packs 4 pixels per byte, MSB = leftmost pixel: a 400 × 300
  PicPak frame is 30 000 bytes, not 60 000, and goes straight to the
  SPI stream without a decode step. Full wire spec in
  [`docs/dev/client-protocol.md`](docs/dev/client-protocol.md).
- **`bwry_4` palette indices swapped to match the controller's
  register.** Palette order is now `(black, white, yellow, red)` so
  index equals wire value: `0x0=black`, `0x1=white`, `0x2=yellow`,
  `0x3=red`. v0.69.3 had yellow and red the other way round, which
  paints a red field on a yellow buffer (and vice versa) on PicPak.

## [0.69.3], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **`bwry_4` gamut for 4-colour B/W/Red/Yellow e-paper panels.**
  New `BWRY_4_PALETTE` constant in
  [`app/quantizer.py`](app/quantizer.py) (black / white / red /
  yellow), plus a nibble LUT and a `bwry_4` entry in
  `_GAMUT_TABLE` so `pack_to_panel_bin` picks it up whenever a
  device declares `panel.gamut = "bwry_4"`. Dense 0-3 nibble
  mapping (`0x0=black`, `0x1=white`, `0x2=red`, `0x3=yellow`); no
  reserved values, so firmware decoders only need to switch over
  the four nibbles. `circuitpython_png` also gains a BWRY branch
  for the indexed-PNG path.
- **`bwry_4` in `ACCEPTED_GAMUTS`** so clients can declare it via
  `POST /api/v1/device/{discover, register}` and the value
  persists onto the auto-provisioned instance's panel block. No
  new endpoints; the API surface stays put, only the allow-list
  widens.

### Changed

- **`docs/dev/client-protocol.md`** documents the new gamut value
  in the accepted-value table and adds a `bwry_4` entry to the
  `.bin` frame-format section with the exact nibble convention
  firmware needs to decode. Targets PicPak-class 400 × 300 4.2"
  BWRY panels (60 000 bytes per frame at 4 bpp).

## [0.69.2], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Delete-with-cascade prompt on the device card** (issue
  [#48](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/48)). The delete
  button no longer fires a browser `confirm()`; it expands an inline
  form with a checkbox showing exactly what would be wiped
  ("Also wipe N bound dashboards, M history rows, per-device
  settings, uploaded calibration image"). Off by default so muscle
  memory doesn't destroy data; on for a clean-slate delete.
- **MAC-differs auto-wipe on re-register.** When a device is deleted
  without ticking the wipe checkbox, Tesserae stashes the device's
  last-known MAC in `data/deleted_device_markers.json`. On
  `POST /api/v1/device/register` or a one-click register from the
  Discovered strip, if the incoming MAC differs from the stored MAC
  (or the client dropped its MAC), the leftover pages / events /
  settings / calibration image are wiped before the new instance is
  created. Same MAC keeps the state; the marker is cleared on either
  path so subsequent registers behave normally.
- **`app.device_cleanup`** package: `list_orphan_state()` and
  `wipe_orphan_state()` are the shared helpers used by both flows.
  `app.state.deleted_device_markers.DeletedDeviceMarkers` is the tiny
  MAC-tracking store.

## [0.69.1], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Optional `gamut` field on `/api/v1/device/discover` +
  `/api/v1/device/register`** (issue
  [#41](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/41)). A generic
  CircuitPython client (or any REST-registering firmware) can now
  declare its colour target in the same payload that carries
  `panel_w` / `panel_h`; the value gets canonicalised through the
  new `app.quantizer.canonicalise_gamut` and persisted onto the
  auto-provisioned instance's panel block. Result: the
  `circuitpython_generic` kind serves every panel shape from one
  manifest with no per-SKU release cycle.
- **Wider `ACCEPTED_GAMUTS`** list: `waveshare_e6`, `inky_7colour`,
  `spectra_6` (aliases to `waveshare_e6`), `acep_7colour` (aliases
  to `inky_7colour`), `mono`, and (per
  [the follow-up comment on issue #41](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/41#issuecomment-4872979793))
  `rgb24` + `rgb16` for full-colour display hybrids. Unknown values
  fall back to `waveshare_e6` at persistence time so a corrupt
  payload can't strand the device with a nonsense panel.

### Changed

- **`Settings → Devices → Discovered` register flow** reads
  `gamut` from the cached discover payload alongside `panel_w` /
  `panel_h` when the admin clicks Register on a discovered device.
- **`circuitpython_png` renderer honours `rgb24` and `rgb16`
  panels** by emitting a plain 24-bit RGB PNG (no palette
  quantise, no dither). `mono` was already wired to the 2-colour
  palette path; this release makes it reachable end-to-end from a
  generic `/register` call. `rgb16` panels pack the 24-bit RGB to
  RGB565 on-device; a raw RGB565 wire format is a bandwidth-only
  follow-up.
- **`docs/dev/client-protocol.md`** documents the new payload
  field + the accepted-value table.

## [0.69.0], 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **PushManager: latest-wins coalescing per device, replacing the
  old `status="busy"` drop path.** Two pushes for the same device
  no longer stomp each other; the earlier one gets
  `status="superseded"` (with a matching History event) and the
  later one paints. User-initiated pushes (Send-file / Send-URL /
  Send-webpage / Send-page / test patterns / republish) pass
  `bypass_coalesce=True` so they always fire. Scheduler and
  auto-refresh flows leave the flag `False`, so back-to-back
  schedule ticks for the same page paint once instead of twice.
- New `PushResult` status: `"superseded"`. Same shape as `"busy"`
  was (event row + error message), so History / HA discovery /
  events log all keep working; downstream consumers only need to
  handle the new string. `"busy"` remains in the `PushStatus`
  literal for backward compat but is no longer emitted.

### Added

- **`bypass_coalesce` kwarg** on `PushManager.push`,
  `.push_image`, `.push_url_image`, `.push_webpage`. Defaults are
  set so the common HTTP-facing surfaces (`push_image` etc.)
  bypass by default (user intent), while `push(page_id)` defaults
  to coalescing (scheduler intent). Send-page's "Send this
  dashboard" button explicitly passes `bypass_coalesce=True` so a
  panic-click never gets silently superseded.

## [0.68.0], 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **Device-card tabs reorganised around hardware setup vs colour
  tuning.** The Rendering tab is retired; Panel & orientation, the
  orientation calibration card (Send + 1/2/3/4 answer), and dither
  algorithm all move onto the appropriate tabs. Panel + orientation
  + orientation calibration land on General (physical-mount
  concerns). Dither algorithm joins contrast, saturation, palette,
  tone and edges on Calibration (colour-rendering concerns). The
  four remaining tabs are Status / General / Schedule /
  Calibration. Legacy `?tab=rendering` URLs redirect to General.
- **Retired the per-clone `calibrated` toggle.** The Calibration-tab
  palette-profile picker is now the single source of truth for
  which palette a device paints. The palette-override plumbing in
  `pack_to_panel_bin` no longer requires `calibrated=True` on the
  clone; a profile-with-palette wins unconditionally. The field
  stays in renderer manifests + storage so pre-v0.68 configs keep
  parsing, but it no longer surfaces in the UI.
- **Consistent UI primitives on the Calibration tab.** Bare
  checkboxes for serpentine scan + preserve-line-art now use the
  shared `switch()` macro; the colour-index dropdown wears the
  standard `.input` class. Tone-editor sliders align to a fixed
  200 px label column so every slider starts and ends at the same
  x.
- **Device-card tab bar scrolls horizontally on narrow viewports.**
  Adds `overflow-x: auto` + `scroll-snap-type: x proximity` on
  `.dx-tabs` so the four tabs stay accessible on mobile without
  wrapping.

### Added

- **Custom calibration image.** Every device grows a small
  "Upload custom calibration image" affordance under the Colour
  test patterns block. Uploaded images (PNG / JPEG / WebP) live at
  `data/calibration_images/<device_id>.png`, get fit-to-panel with
  white padding at render time, and surface as a new
  `Your uploaded image` entry in the pattern picker. Delete button
  removes the file idempotently.
- **Live palette preview.** Nudging any of the six/seven palette
  colour swatches on the Calibration tab now repaints the inline
  preview `<img>` on the same tick, matching the tone-slider live
  behaviour that shipped in v0.67.4. Works for both Waveshare E6
  (6 colours) and ACeP / Inky 7-colour (adds orange).
- **Device card stays open after Save.** The combined-form redirect
  threads `?opened=<device_id>` back to the settings index, and the
  device card checks that flag alongside the existing
  `?calibrating=<id>` flow to render `data-collapsed="false"`. No
  more re-opening the card after every save.

## [0.67.5], 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- **`mypy` strict CI failure on `_error_diffusion`'s LAB scratch
  buffers.** The v0.67.4 introduction of the LAB colour-match path
  initialised the scratch buffers as `None` in the RGB-only branch,
  which type-checked locally against the strict-modules list but
  tripped the CI-wide `mypy app` run (91 files) on the buffer
  indexing. Declare the buffers up-front with concrete types and
  leave them empty in the RGB path so the indexed reads inside
  `if use_lab:` type-check consistently. No runtime behaviour
  change.

## [0.67.4], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **LAB dynamic-range compression on palette profiles.** New
  `_compress_lab_range` helper in `app.quantizer` rescales a
  source's L* channel into `[lab_compress_min, lab_compress_max]`
  while leaving a* and b* untouched, preserving hue while
  squeezing brightness into whatever the target panel can
  reproduce. Two matching sliders (min / max, 0-100) join the tone
  editor on the Calibration tab. Overrides the linear
  `_compress_to_calibrated_range` when set; default `(0, 100)` is
  a no-op fast path so profiles without the knob set render
  byte-identical.
- **Colour-match modes (`rgb` / `lab` / `chroma-aware`)** on the
  error-diffusion dithers (`floyd-steinberg`, `atkinson`,
  `jarvis`, `stucki`). `lab` picks each pixel's nearest palette
  entry in CIE L*a*b* space instead of sRGB; `chroma-aware`
  weights a*/b* differences 2x to preserve hue over lightness.
  Pillow's built-in FS is RGB-only, so when a profile picks
  `lab` / `chroma-aware` and the algorithm is `floyd-steinberg`,
  the packer detours through the numpy error-diffusion path with
  FS weights.
- **New sRGB<->LAB conversion helpers** (`_srgb_to_lab`,
  `_lab_to_srgb`) in `app.quantizer`. Standard D65 sRGB gamma +
  CIELAB nonlinearity; vectorised numpy, round-trips within a 4-
  per-channel delta (documented in
  `test_srgb_lab_round_trip_is_lossless_within_a_delta`).
- **Tone-aware test-pattern preview.** The Calibration-tab preview
  now reflects the applied profile's palette, exposure, S-curve,
  LAB compression, and smoothing radius; sliders update the
  preview `<img>` live via a query-string handshake before the
  user hits Save. Dither / colour-match / preserve-line-art stay
  render-time only (they're per-pixel and would need the full
  `pack_to_panel_bin` round-trip to replay in the preview).

## [0.67.3], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Per-colour palette editor on the Calibration tab.** The
  palette recalibration card grows a grid of six (Spectra 6) or
  seven (Inky 7-colour) native `<input type="color">` swatches
  with a live `#rrggbb` readout below each. Users can eyeball-
  match each palette entry against what their panel actually
  reproduces, without editing JSON. New endpoint
  `POST /settings/devices/<id>/palette/update-palette` handles the
  fork-or-edit-in-place logic: bundled presets fork into a user
  profile named "<name> (edited)" on first tweak; user profiles
  are edited in place. Bad hex values fall through to the base
  preset's value rather than being written as-is.

## [0.67.2], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Experimental edge handling on the Calibration tab.** The tone
  editor grows an "Experimental: edge handling" fold-out with two
  new knobs: **Smoothing radius** (0-3 px, Gaussian blur applied
  before tone mapping to soften antialiased edges before dither
  can build a noisy tail along them) and **Preserve line-art
  edges** (post-dither pass that detects sharp edges in the tone-
  mapped source and swaps those pixels for nearest-neighbour
  quantise so text and hairline rules stay crisp).
- **`smoothing_radius` + `preserve_line_art` on
  `pack_to_panel_bin`.** Both default to their pre-v0.67.2 neutral
  values (0 and False), so devices with no profile applied render
  byte-identical to v0.67.1
  (`test_pack_edge_defaults_match_pre_v672`). `esp32_bin` /
  `pi_bin` / `pico_bin` pass the profile's edges block through.
  `preserve_line_art` costs zero on all-photo sources (edge mask
  is empty).

## [0.67.1], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Tone + dither editor on the Calibration tab.** The palette
  card now grows four sliders / toggles that write to the active
  profile: **Exposure** (-100..+100 linear brightness shift),
  **S-curve** (-100..+100 mid-tone punch via a sigmoid), **Diffusion
  strength** (0..200 for error-diffusion dithers; 100 = normal),
  and **Serpentine scan** (flips scan direction each row, hides
  the diagonal worming pattern on gradients). Editing a bundled
  preset forks it into an editable user profile named "<name>
  (edited)" on first tweak; subsequent edits update the fork in
  place. User profiles are edited directly.
- **Palette-profile tone + dither now take effect at render
  time.** `app.push` injects `_profile_tone` and `_profile_dither`
  into settings alongside `_palette_override`; `esp32_bin`,
  `pi_bin`, `pico_bin`, and `trmnl_png_color` pass them through
  to `app.quantizer.pack_to_panel_bin`. Devices with no profile
  applied render byte-identical to pre-v0.67.1 (verified in
  `test_pack_neutral_knobs_match_pre_v67_defaults`).
- **New route** `POST /settings/devices/<id>/palette/update-tone`
  handles the fork-or-edit-in-place logic behind the tone editor.

## [0.67.0], 2026-07-04

### Added

- **Palette recalibration on the Calibration tab.** Every device
  card grows a "Palette recalibration" section that lets the user
  pick from six pre-measured palette profiles per gamut (Spectra 6
  + Inky 7-colour) sourced from
  [paperlesspaper/epdoptimize](https://github.com/paperlesspaper/epdoptimize)
  (`spectra6`, `spectra6legacy`, `spectra6-boeber`,
  `aitjcize-spectra6`, `acep`), plus a "Nominal (uncalibrated)"
  identity fallback. Bundled presets carry `based_on` +
  `attribution` fields that surface as a "via paperlesspaper /
  epdoptimize" line on the picker. Applied profile is stored per
  device at `settings.devices.<id>.palette_profile_slug`.
- **Save-as-new, import, export, delete for palette profiles.**
  Users can fork any bundled preset into a named custom profile
  (saved at `data/palette_profiles/<slug>.json`), import a JSON
  profile shared by someone else, download a profile via
  `GET /settings/palette-profiles/<slug>/export.json`, and delete
  their own custom profiles. Bundled profiles refuse deletion.
- **Palette override wired through the `.bin` renderers**
  (`esp32_bin`, `pi_bin`, `pico_bin`, plus `trmnl_png_color` on
  the PNG side). When a device has a profile applied AND the
  renderer clone's `calibrated` toggle is on, the profile's
  palette wins over the built-in `_CALIBRATED_PALETTES` lookup in
  `app.quantizer`. `pi_png` and `trmnl_png` don't gain server-side
  palette override in this release (their quantisation lives on
  the client or is mono).
- **Palette-profile schema, store, and bundled table** in the new
  [`app.palette_profiles`](app/palette_profiles/) package.
  Forward-compatible: unknown JSON fields are ignored on load,
  out-of-range tone values are clamped, bad hex codes fall through
  to `#000000` so a corrupt profile can't crash a render.
- **Developer docs** at
  [`docs/dev/calibration.md`](docs/dev/calibration.md) explaining
  the schema, storage layout, and how to add a new bundled preset.

### Changed

- **Contrast + saturation moved from Rendering → Calibration.** The
  two tone-mapping fields that were surfaced in each device card's
  Picture-quality subsection (Rendering tab) now render on the
  Calibration tab alongside the palette picker. Storage is
  unchanged (still per-clone
  `settings.renderers.<clone_id>.contrast` / `.saturation`) so
  existing configs read forward without migration.
- **`NOTICES.md`** carries a new sub-section documenting the
  paperlesspaper/epdoptimize palette data reused as bundled
  presets, alongside the existing entry for the calibrated palette
  values in `app.quantizer`.

## [0.66.1], 2026-07-04

### Changed

- **Calibration tab: two-column layout for colour test patterns.**
  Pattern picker + colour + submit stack on the left; preview
  stretches on the right and fills the vertical space so portrait
  panels (Seeed XIAO EE02, reTerminal E1004) render at a readable
  size instead of being squeezed to a thumbnail. Stacks under
  720 px so the picker keeps its full width on narrow viewports.

### Removed

- **Legacy "Calibrate" chip in the device-card footer.** Orientation
  calibration + colour test patterns are now on the Calibration tab;
  the footer chip introduced in v0.66.0 as a deep-link is gone since
  the tab itself is the surface.

## [0.66.0], 2026-07-03

### Added

- **New Calibration tab on every device card** (Settings → Devices).
  A fifth tab alongside Status / General / Rendering / Schedule that
  consolidates the existing orientation calibration flow with a new
  colour-test-pattern picker. Five patterns ship: palette swatches
  (labelled solid block per palette entry), 16-step grayscale ramp,
  solid fill (per-colour), text sample (three sizes), and a
  registration grid (1 px + 2 px lines with corner marks). The
  legacy footer "Calibrate" button becomes a deep-link chip that
  jumps straight to the new tab, so muscle memory holds.
- **Test patterns are palette-locked to the panel's gamut**, so the
  renderer's dither pass has zero error to diffuse and what the tab's
  inline preview shows is byte-identical to what the panel paints.
  Snaps automatically to `waveshare_e6` or `inky_7colour` based on
  the device's declared gamut and honours the per-clone `calibrated`
  toggle (measured palette from
  [epdoptimize](https://github.com/paperlesspaper/epdoptimize) when
  on, nominal palette when off). Custom / unknown gamuts fall back
  to E6 rather than crashing.
- **Two new routes** back the tab:
  `POST /settings/devices/<id>/test-pattern` hands PNG bytes to
  `PushManager.push_image` (same path the Send-file / Send-URL flows
  use, so the device's real renderer + transport paint the panel);
  `GET /settings/devices/<id>/test-pattern/preview.png` returns the
  same bytes for the tab's inline preview `<img>`. The palette
  recalibration slot is scaffolded but disabled until LAB-aware
  quantisation lands.

## [0.65.2], 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **Picking Atkinson / Jarvis / Stucki / Bayer 8x8 / halftone /
  crosshatch as a device's dither mode no longer crashes the push
  (issue [#47](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/47)).**
  `app.quantizer.quantize()` only accepted the two dither modes
  Pillow ships built-in (`floyd-steinberg` and `none`) and raised
  `ValueError: unsupported Pillow dither mode: 'atkinson'` for the
  other six declared in `DitherMode`, even though the UI offers all
  eight in the device dither dropdown. `quantize()` now falls
  through to the same numpy-backed error-diffusion (Atkinson /
  Jarvis / Stucki) and ordered (Bayer / halftone / crosshatch)
  implementations `pack_to_panel_bin` already uses; the resulting
  palette-index buffer is projected back through the palette to
  recover an RGB image. The `trmnl_png` and `trmnl_png_color`
  renderers now paint any dither mode the UI lets a user pick.

## [0.65.1], 2026-07-03

### Added

- **[`docs/install/buttons`](install/buttons.md)**: new user-facing
  guide for the button feature. Covers the default map, per-device
  editor (**Settings → Devices → General → Buttons**), the full
  action list (`rotate_prev`, `rotate_next`, `refresh`,
  `step:<i>`, `page:<page_id>`, `webhook:<url>`), manual override
  behaviour, dedup semantics, and how button events appear on the
  History page. Wired into the docs nav under **Set up a device**.
- **`schema/openapi.yaml`** now documents the button contract:
  `button` query param on `GET /api/v1/device/{device_id}/frame`,
  `button` + `button_event_id` optional fields on the status body,
  the `rotation` envelope on both `FrameEnvelope` and
  `DeviceStatusResponse`, and the `Content-Location` response
  header on the frame endpoint's `200` + `304` branches. New
  reusable schemas: `RotationEnvelope` and the `ButtonQueryParam` /
  `ContentLocation` component definitions.
- **Cross-links from the surfaces users actually land on:** the
  [Seeed featured hardware page](hardware/seeed.md), the
  [unified Seeed quickstart](quickstart/seeed-unified.md), and the
  ["Set up a device"](install/devices.md) guide all now point at
  the buttons guide.

## [0.65.0], 2026-07-03

**The reTerminal launch release.** Everything the Seeed reTerminal
E-Series needs to land as a first-class Tesserae target, plus
physical button wakes for the whole ESP32 firmware family, a
community layer, and a stack of reliability + docs work rolled up
from thirteen 0.64.x patches. Detailed per-patch notes remain
below.

### Highlights

- **Native firmware for the Seeed reTerminal E-Series and the wider
  XIAO ePaper family**, browser-flashable at
  [`tesserae.ink/flash`](https://tesserae.ink/flash). One codebase
  (`tesserae-device-firmware`) covers E1001 (7.5" mono), E1002 (7.3"
  Spectra 6), E1003 (10.3" mono, 16-level grey), E1004 (13.3" Spectra
  6), the XIAO EE02 (13.3" Spectra 6), and the XIAO 7.5" mono. No
  ESP-IDF toolchain, no TRMNL account, no BYOS proxy.
- **Physical button wakes** on every ESP32 client. Firmware carries
  the pressed button in `/frame` (`?button=<name>`) and `/status`
  (`{button, button_event_id}`), the server resolves it through a
  per-device `button_map` (default: `left → rotate_prev`, `right →
  rotate_next`, `refresh → refresh`) with global + hardcoded
  fallbacks, dedups against the monotonic `button_event_id`,
  dispatches through an extensible action registry (`rotate_prev`,
  `rotate_next`, `refresh`, `step:<i>`, `page:<page_id>`,
  `webhook:<url>`), persists the new rotation position with a
  sticky-until-next-anchor manual override, and pushes the resulting
  page synchronously so the returned frame reflects the new state on
  the same wake. Admin UI + full History integration land at the
  same time.
- **`Content-Location` on `/frame`** (200 *and* 304) so a client that
  boots without a cached URL (non-e-ink panels, factory reset) can
  re-fetch the image without needing to have persisted the URL
  alongside its ETag. RFC 7231 §3.1.4.2 explicitly permits
  `Content-Location` on 304 for exactly this.
- **Community layer live.** Discord server up, community CTAs
  (Discussions + Discord + Sponsor) on the onboarding wrap-up step,
  the app footer, and the Settings → About card. First community
  sponsor, first external client contribution (Bernhard's
  CircuitPython client), and first external PR all landed in the
  0.64.x series ahead of the launch push.
- **Widget failure isolation.** A dead upstream API (e.g. the
  Open-Meteo outage on 2026-07-03) no longer sinks the whole
  dashboard render; each widget shows its own error tile and the
  rest of the page paints normally. Composer no longer waits on
  stuck HTTP threads past the overall hydration budget.
- **New docs surfaces.** Unified Seeed quickstart, Featured hardware
  page for the reTerminal E-Series, per-vendor Hardware SKUs section
  on the compatibility page, and a full protocol write-up for
  button events, rotation state, and the `Content-Location` header.

### Added

- **Server-side handling for physical button wakes on ESP32 devices**
  (0.64.70): action registry, per-device + global `button_map` with
  hardcoded defaults, dedup by `button_event_id` (or same-button
  time-window fallback), sticky manual override, rotation envelope on
  responses, admin UI for editing the map, per-event History rows
  with the `button` source label + `hand-tap` icon + filter chip.
- **`Content-Location` header on `/api/v1/device/<id>/frame`** (this
  release), on both 200 and 304 responses. Zero-cost to existing
  e-ink firmwares; unlocks non-e-ink and reset-cycle recovery for
  new client families. Documented in `client-protocol.md` alongside
  a note that the URL is also deterministic from the `render_id`
  (`<server-base>/renders/<render_id>.<format>`) so the most memory-
  constrained targets can reconstruct without reading the header.
- **Community CTAs across the app** (0.64.69): Discussions + Discord
  + Sponsor on the onboarding wrap-up step, the app footer, and the
  Settings → About card. URLs live in a single app-wide context
  processor so a link update happens in one place.
- **Featured Seeed hardware page** on the docs site (0.64.65),
  reachable from the nav under Featured hardware and from the
  landing page's "New here?" tip. Frames the reTerminal E-Series as
  the ready-to-go hardware path (browser flash, battery-powered, no
  assembly required) with a slot for the group photo.
- **Six Seeed hardware manifests** (0.64.60–0.64.65): reTerminal
  E1001–E1004, XIAO ePaper EE02, XIAO ePaper 7.5" mono. Plus the
  Waveshare PhotoPainter 7.3" (0.64.60) unified under
  `tesserae-device-firmware`.
- **Unified Seeed quickstart** covering every SKU via one firmware +
  one flasher (0.64.63).
- **Hardware SKUs section on the compatibility page** with a per-
  vendor intro map so surfacing a new vendor is one config entry
  (0.64.64).
- **History page detail line + friendly device names for button
  rows** (0.64.73): device chip resolved through the registry, and a
  synthesised `button right → rotate_next pushed Afternoon calendar`
  line under the main row so the outcome is visible without
  expanding raw JSON.

### Changed

- **Install-a-client docs** now lead with `tesserae-device-firmware`
  and the browser flasher; the standalone Waveshare firmware repos
  covered by the unified build were removed from the client table
  (0.64.67).
- **README's Seeed section** reframed from TRMNL BYOS to Tesserae-
  native, with every reTerminal SKU marked ✅ and every row linking
  the firmware repo. E1002 corrected from ACeP to Spectra 6, E1003
  dims corrected to 1872×1404. XIAO EE02 row added. Compatibility
  page's Seeed section gains a firmware-and-flasher intro paragraph
  via a new `VENDOR_INTRO` map (0.64.65).
- **Docs landing page** gets a ready-to-go hardware row in the "New
  here?" tip alongside "I want it running" and "I have a panel to
  drive" (0.64.65).
- **Mobile dashboard editor** drops the sticky preview at the top of
  the viewport in favour of the existing floating back-to-top FAB
  (0.64.66). Desktop's sticky-in-right-column behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **Docker workflow's GHA cache** scoped per ref
  (`scope=${{ github.ref_name }}`) so parallel main + tag pushes on
  a release stop racing on layer blob writes (0.64.68).
- **Client-protocol spec** now covers the button contract (query
  param on `/frame`, body fields on `/status`, response envelope
  shape, `refresh`-drops-ETag convention) and the `Content-Location`
  header on `/frame` (0.64.70 + this release).

### Fixed

- **Dead upstream weather API no longer sinks the whole dashboard
  render** (0.64.72). Composer's `ThreadPoolExecutor` now shuts
  down with `cancel_futures=True` so stuck HTTP threads don't hold
  the composer past Playwright's `page.goto` budget. The four
  `weather_*` widgets pass `retries=0` and `timeout=5` to
  `fetch_json` so a hard Open-Meteo outage returns
  `{"error": ...}` to the widget in ~5s and the cell paints its
  error state instead of stalling the whole page.
- **Mypy strict errors on `app/button_service.py`** that slipped past
  local pytest (0.64.71).
- **Docker workflow race on release pushes** where parallel main + tag
  runs shared one GHA cache namespace and one always failed on
  `error writing layer blob: not_found` (0.64.68).
- **Panel-preset table column widths + a stale Seeed manifest URL**
  (0.64.64).

## [0.64.73], 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **History page shows the friendly device name + a detail line for
  button events.** Previously button rows showed the raw device id
  in the target column and buried every interesting field (the
  pressed button name, the resolved action spec, the pushed page id,
  the rotation position) inside `extra`, invisible to the row
  renderer. `history_view` in `app/history_routes.py` now resolves
  the button-row target through the device registry (so `kitchen`
  reads as e.g. "Kitchen wall panel"), adds a device chip for the
  target, and synthesises a short `button_detail` string like
  `button right → rotate_next pushed Afternoon calendar`. The
  template renders that as a muted second line under the main row so
  the full outcome is visible without a JSON expand pane.
  `_button_detail` gracefully falls back to `action_description` when
  no spec is present (deduped / unmapped rows still read cleanly)
  and returns `None` when the extras are empty so the template drops
  the line entirely.

## [0.64.72], 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **Dead upstream weather API no longer sinks the whole dashboard
  render.** The failure chain hit during the 2026-07-03 Open-Meteo
  outage was: `fetch_json`'s default `retries=1` compounded to ~31s
  of blocking per widget on a hard timeout; the composer's
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` context manager waited (default `wait=True`)
  for those stuck HTTP threads to finish before returning; the
  hydration step therefore held the composer past Playwright's 15s
  `page.goto` budget; Playwright reported a broken navigation and the
  screenshot captured an empty page. Two levels of fix:
  1. **`app/composer.py`** now shuts the pool down with
     `shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True)` on exit, so stuck
     HTTP threads no longer hold up the composer once the overall
     12s cap fires. Also drops the per-widget cap from 10s to 6s so a
     single 15s HTTP-level timeout can't push a well-behaved widget's
     wall-time past the overall budget.
  2. **The four `weather_*` widgets** (`weather_now`,
     `weather_forecast`, `weather_hourly`, `weather_now_scenic`) now
     call `fetch_json` with `retries=0` and `timeout=5`, so a hard
     Open-Meteo outage returns `{"error": ...}` to the widget in ~5s
     and the cell paints its `data.error` state instead of stalling
     the whole page render. The 10-minute per-location cache means
     healthy upstreams still serve fresh data without changes.

## [0.64.71], 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **Two mypy errors in `app/button_service.py` that slipped past
  local pytest.** Line 142 carried an unused
  `type: ignore[assignment]` now that the push-manager getter type
  widens correctly, and the webhook payload literal inferred as
  `dict[str, int | str | None]`, which doesn't satisfy
  `_fire_webhook_async`'s `dict[str, object]` parameter under mypy's
  invariant value semantics. An explicit `dict[str, object]`
  annotation on the payload literal fixes both without changing
  behaviour. `mypy app/` clean.

## [0.64.70], 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Server-side handling for physical button wakes on ESP32 devices.**
  On a button-driven wake the firmware carries the pressed button in
  the frame query (`GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame?button=<name>`) and
  in the status body (`{"button": "<name>", "button_event_id": <uint>,
  ...}`). The server dispatches the mapped action synchronously before
  selecting the frame so the returned artefact already reflects the
  new state on this same wake, and persists the new position so
  later timer wakes continue from there.
- **Configurable per-device `button_map` with global fallback.** The
  hardcoded default is `{"left": "rotate_prev", "right":
  "rotate_next", "refresh": "refresh"}`. Precedence:
  `settings.devices.<id>.button_map` beats `settings.app.button_map`
  beats default. Values are `<action>` or `<action>:<arg>` strings so
  the config surface stays JSON-flat.
- **Action registry** at [`app/button_actions.py`](app/button_actions.py):
  `rotate_prev`, `rotate_next`, `refresh`, `step:<index>` (jump to a
  specific rotation step), `page:<page_id>` (push a specific dashboard
  to this device without touching rotation state), and `webhook:<url>`
  (stub, validates shape). Third-party plugins can add actions via
  `register(name, fn)`. Adding a new button id or action needs only a
  config / registry change.
- **Debounce + idempotency** via `button_event_id`. The firmware
  sends a monotonically increasing uint; the server treats any
  incoming id `<= last processed` as a retry and no-ops. Firmwares
  without the counter fall back to a same-button-within-N-seconds
  window, default 3s, overridable via `settings.app.button_debounce_s`.
- **`rotation` envelope on the `/frame` and `/status` responses**
  (`{rotation_id, step_index, step_page_id, step_count,
  manual_override, override_until}`). Present when the device is
  bound to at least one enabled rotation, omitted otherwise. Lets an
  admin UI show where the device is and pair a per-device
  `button_map` editor to reality.
- **New state:** [`app/state/device_rotation_state_model.py`](app/state/device_rotation_state_model.py)
  + [`app/state/device_rotation_state_store.py`](app/state/device_rotation_state_store.py)
  persist per-device manual position, override expiry, and button
  dedup fingerprint. Default is "sticky until the rotation's next
  daily anchor" so a button press doesn't get yanked back by the
  scheduler a minute later; overridable via
  `settings.app.button_hold_seconds`.
- **Client-protocol docs** at
  [`docs/dev/client-protocol.md`](docs/dev/client-protocol.md) now
  cover the button contract: query param on `/frame`, body fields on
  `/status`, response envelope shape, and the `refresh`-drops-ETag
  convention firmwares should honour.
- **Unmapped buttons** log a warning and return the current frame
  without state change; malformed action args (`step:abc`,
  `page:unknown`, `webhook:ftp://…`) do the same. Rotations that
  aren't bound to a device silently no-op on rotation-manipulating
  actions but still work for `page:<id>` / `webhook:<url>` shortcuts.
- **Tests** for the action registry, the state store, and the
  service integration (dedup by event id, dedup by time window,
  per-device config precedence, `page:` shortcut semantics,
  push-failure resilience).
- **Webhook action fires in a daemon thread** with a 3s timeout
  (overridable via `settings.app.button_webhook_timeout_s`). The
  POST body carries `{device_id, button, button_event_id,
  action_spec, timestamp, rotation_id, step_index, step_page_id}`,
  content-type `application/json`. Failures are logged and swallowed
  so `/frame` never blocks on an unhealthy external endpoint.
- **Per-device button map editor on the Settings → Devices card**
  (General tab). A JSON textarea for the raw `button_map`, plus a
  fold-out showing the resolved effective map (default merged with
  the global map merged with the per-device override). The registered
  actions list is generated from the runtime registry so third-party
  plugins that call `register(...)` at import time show up in the
  help text automatically. Save is wired into the existing combined
  save endpoint; validation rejects malformed JSON, non-string
  values, unknown actions, and bad action arg shapes before writing.
- **Every button press writes a History row.** ButtonService emits
  one event log entry per dispatched press with source `button`, the
  button name, the resolved action spec, and the resulting state
  (rotation position, pushed page id, manual-override flag), covering
  every outcome the admin can care about: `dispatched`, `deduped`,
  `unmapped`, `error`, `webhook_dispatched`, and `noop`. The row is
  in addition to the push row `PushManager` already logs, so a
  state-changing wake produces two correlated rows (one for the
  button event, one for the resulting page push). `templates/history`
  and `app/history_routes.py` gain the `button` source label + icon
  (`hand-tap`) + filter chip so the button feed is a first-class view
  on the History page.

## [0.64.69], 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Community CTA block on the onboarding wrap-up step and mirrored on
  the Settings → About card.** Three CTAs (GitHub Discussions,
  Discord, Sponsor) with the same copy, icons, and styling on both
  surfaces so a first-time user and a long-time user land on the same
  set of community links. URLs live in a single spot: the app-wide
  context processor in `app_factory.py` exposes
  `community_discussions_url`, `community_discord_url`, and
  `community_sponsor_url`, and the templates read from there. Update
  in one place if a link changes.
- **Discord invite link (`https://discord.gg/6qmwkGhGR7`) now shipped
  in the footer, the onboarding wrap-up, and the About card**, so
  users can find the server from wherever they are in the app.

### Changed

- **App footer now carries Discussions + Discord + Sponsor links
  alongside the release tag.** The previous `dmello.io` blog link has
  been removed in favour of the community set; the release version
  chip and the Sponsor heart both remain. All links go through
  `rel="noreferrer noopener"` so the destination never sees a Referer
  header pointing at the host's LAN address.
- **Settings → About card layout consolidated.** The standalone
  "Support the project" section has been folded into a new "Join the
  community" card that pairs Discussions + Discord + Sponsor as three
  CTA rows, matching the onboarding wrap-up. The "Discussions" row is
  removed from the meta list since the same link now lives one card
  down in a more prominent format. The "Tell us how you use Tesserae"
  survey card is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Docker workflow's GitHub Actions Cache write race on release
  pushes.** Pushing `main` + a `v*` tag together fires the docker
  workflow twice in parallel (once per ref), and both runs wrote to the
  same GHA cache namespace. The second write hit
  `error writing layer blob: not_found` on layer blobs the first run
  had just cleaned up, and the workflow reported a failure even though
  every image manifest had already published to GHCR. Scoping the
  cache per ref via
  `cache-from: type=gha,scope=${{ github.ref_name }}` (and the
  equivalent `cache-to`) gives `main`, each tag, and PR builds their
  own cache namespace so the two release-time runs stop colliding.
  Cache reuse within a single ref is unchanged.

## [0.64.67], 2026-07-03

### Changed

- **[`docs/install/clients`](install/clients.md)** now leads with the
  unified [`tesserae-device-firmware`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-firmware)
  and the browser flasher at [`tesserae.ink/flash`](https://tesserae.ink/flash)
  as the primary ESP32 client path, and drops the standalone
  `tesserae-device-esp32-bin` (Waveshare 13.3" Spectra 6) and
  `tesserae-device-photopainter-7.3-bin` (Waveshare PhotoPainter 7.3")
  sections since both boards are now covered by the unified firmware.
  Client table gains a `tesserae-device-firmware` row listing every SKU
  it covers (reTerminal E1001-E1004, XIAO EE02, XIAO 7.5", Waveshare
  13.3" Spectra 6, PhotoPainter 7.3"). Fixes an orphaned "the 13.3"
  client" reference in the `esp32-bw` section that pointed at the now
  removed heading.

## [0.64.66], 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **Dashboard editor's mobile preview no longer pins to the top of the
  viewport.** The preview card now scrolls with the rest of the page
  and the existing floating back-to-top FAB reappears once it leaves
  the viewport. The FAB's `IntersectionObserver` was already generic,
  so no JS change was needed. Also un-hides the "Live preview" title
  and the panel-dims line on mobile, since they were only hidden to
  maximise the preview area inside the pinned strip. Desktop's
  sticky-in-right-column behaviour is unchanged.

## [0.64.65], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **[`docs/hardware/seeed`](hardware/seeed.md)**: new dedicated
  featured-hardware page for the Seeed reTerminal E-Series and the
  wider XIAO ePaper family. Frames the E-Series as the ready-to-go
  hardware path (browser flash, battery-powered, no assembly
  required), lists every supported SKU with panel, colour, and
  resolution, walks through the getting-started flow, and reserves a
  slot for the group photo shoot. Reachable from the docs nav under
  **Featured hardware** and from the landing page's "New here?" tip.

### Changed

- **[`README`](README.md)** Seeed section now leads with the native
  [`tesserae-device-firmware`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-firmware)
  and the [`tesserae.ink/flash`](https://tesserae.ink/flash) browser
  flasher rather than the older TRMNL BYOS framing. Every row in the
  Seeed table links `tesserae-device-firmware` as the client and
  reflects real-hardware status for the reTerminal E1001, E1002,
  E1003, and E1004 (all painting). Also adds the previously-missing
  XIAO ePaper EE02 row and corrects the E1002 panel column to Spectra
  6 (was ACeP) plus the E1003 dims to 1872×1404 landscape.
- **[`docs/compatibility`](compatibility.md)** Seeed hardware section
  now carries an intro paragraph pointing at the firmware repo, the
  web flasher, and the "battery-powered, no assembly required"
  framing before the SKU table. Rendered by a new `VENDOR_INTRO` map
  in `scripts/gen_compatibility.py` so any vendor section can pick up
  the same treatment without a code change.
- **[`docs/index`](index.md)** landing page's "New here?" tip now
  includes the ready-to-go hardware path (linking the new Seeed
  featured page) as a distinct row alongside "I want it running" and
  "I have a panel to drive", so a first-time visitor lands on a
  concrete "buy this and flash it" option without having to read the
  compatibility matrix.

## [0.64.64], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **[`docs/compatibility`](compatibility.md)** now includes a per-vendor
  **Hardware SKUs** section listing every device manifest in
  `hardware/<vendor>/*.json`, with panel dims, gamut, protocol,
  renderer wiring, and a product-page link per row. Vendor sections
  are ordered Seeed → Pimoroni → TRMNL → Waveshare (Seeed first per
  the Seeed ecosystem commitment), with any additional vendor
  directory picked up automatically without a code change. The
  compatibility page's intro now describes the hardware catalog + the
  MQTT vs REST split, and points readers at the Hardware SKUs section
  as the fastest way to find their device.
- **`scripts/gen_compatibility.py`** grows a `_hardware_by_vendor` +
  `_hardware_sections` pair that walks `hardware/<vendor>/*.json` and
  renders per-vendor markdown tables. `VENDOR_ORDER` and `VENDOR_URL`
  hoist vendor labels / storefronts to the top of the module for a
  quick edit if a new vendor lands or a URL changes.

### Fixed

- **Panel-preset table's Native resolution column was truncated on
  labels containing hyphens.** `_panel_table` split on `-`, which
  ate the resolution when a preset label contained a
  parenthesised suffix with a hyphen (`(ESP32-S3)` → resolution
  stranded as `S3), 800x480`). Now splits on the trailing `, ` so
  `Waveshare 7.3" PhotoPainter (ESP32-S3)` reads cleanly.
- **Seeed XIAO EE02 hardware manifest's `url` field pointed at the
  reTerminal E1004 product page.** Copy-paste error from v0.64.61
  (both are 13.3" Spectra 6). Corrected to the EE02's own page at
  seeedstudio.com. Also visible on the compatibility page's Seeed
  section as of the same release.

## [0.64.63], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **[`docs/quickstart/seeed-unified.md`](quickstart/seeed-unified.md)**:
  new unified quickstart for every Seeed ePaper device Tesserae
  supports via the native `tesserae-device-firmware` build. Covers
  the reTerminal E1001 / E1002 / E1003 / E1004, the XIAO EE02, and
  the XIAO ePaper 7.5" mono, all via one web-based flasher at
  [tesserae.ink/flash](https://tesserae.ink/flash). Includes a
  panel-vs-firmware-kind matrix, per-device notes on refresh
  behaviour and known battery reporting gaps, and a troubleshooting
  table for the common first-boot failures. Featured on the
  quickstart index above the Waveshare + TRMNL guides.

### Changed

- **[`docs/quickstart/seeed-reterminal.md`](quickstart/seeed-reterminal.md)**
  and **[`docs/quickstart/seeed-xiao.md`](quickstart/seeed-xiao.md)**
  now open with a "there's a better path now" callout pointing at
  the unified firmware guide, and are renamed in the nav to `(TRMNL
  BYOS)` variants. Both pages stay for users who deliberately want
  to run TRMNL BYOS firmware on Seeed hardware.

## [0.64.62], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`hardware/seeed/xiao_epaper_75.json`**: Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3
  driving a 7.5" 800×480 monochrome ePaper panel (the same panel
  used in the TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY kit). Routes through the
  `esp32_bw_client` protocol + `esp32_bw_bin` renderer, producing
  a byte-identical frame to the Seeed reTerminal E1001 (48000
  bytes, MSB=leftmost, bit-set=white). No new renderer needed.
  `protocol_config.model_header` set to `XIAO_ePaper_75` for
  firmware auto-provisioning. Coexists with the pre-existing
  `seeed_xiao_75` (which stays for the TRMNL-BYOS-flashed variant
  of the same panel).

## [0.64.61], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`hardware/seeed/ee02.json`**: Seeed XIAO ePaper Driver Board
  EE02 (ESP32-S3) driving a 13.3" T133A01 6-colour Spectra E6
  panel (1200×1600). Routes through the `esp32_client` protocol +
  `esp32_bin` renderer, producing a byte-identical frame to the
  Seeed reTerminal E1004 and the Waveshare 13.3E6 targets (960000
  bytes, high nibble = left column, palette nibbles 0x0..0x6 with
  0x4 / 0x7 reserved). No new renderer needed; the E1004 output
  can be re-pointed at the EE02 for cross-panel validation.
  `protocol_config.model_header` set to `Seeed_EE02` for firmware
  auto-provisioning.

## [0.64.60], 2026-07-02

### Added

- **`hardware/waveshare/photopainter_73.json`**: Waveshare
  PhotoPainter 7.3" (ESP32-S3, 800×480 6-colour Spectra E6,
  battery-powered). Routes through the `esp32_client` protocol +
  `esp32_bin` renderer at 800×480, producing a byte-identical
  frame to the Seeed reTerminal E1002 (192000 bytes, high nibble =
  left column, palette nibbles 0x0..0x6 with 0x4 / 0x7 reserved).
  No new renderer needed; the E1002 output can be re-pointed at the
  PhotoPainter as a sanity check. `protocol_config.model_header`
  set to `PhotoPainter_73` for firmware auto-provisioning. Notes
  flag the physical 180° panel mount inside the case; the firmware
  rotates on-device so the server keeps rendering in normal
  top-left orientation.

## [0.64.59], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Strip an unused `# type: ignore` comment in the v0.64.58 API error
  handler that mypy strict flagged in CI. Runtime behaviour
  unchanged; the annotation was over-cautious.

## [0.64.58], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **`/api/v1/device/<id>/frame` and `/status` returned 403 for a URL
  id that didn't correspond to any registered device.** The
  ``_auth_device`` helper collapsed two failure modes ("id doesn't
  exist" and "id exists but the token belongs to a different device")
  behind one 403, which read as an auth failure on what was actually
  a client-side URL typo. Split them: a URL id that doesn't resolve
  to a registered instance now returns **404 `no device with id
  'foo'`**; the 403 stays for the "valid token, but for a different
  registered device" case. Device ids are admin-chosen (not
  attacker-guessable) so the resource-existence signal isn't a
  meaningful information leak. Reported while wiring a CircuitPython
  client against the REST API.
- **404 / 405 / 500 responses under `/api/v1/device/*` returned
  HTML instead of JSON.** Firmware clients don't render HTML; a
  stray route (POST to `/status` with a missing id, POST to `/frame`
  which is GET-only, etc.) landed on Flask's default HTML error
  page and left the caller staring at a bytes-of-markup blob.
  Registered app-level error handlers that check the request path,
  so any 4xx / 5xx under the `/api/v1/device` prefix returns the
  same `{status, error}` envelope the hand-written auth failures
  already use. The admin UI's 404s continue to render HTML.

## [0.64.57], 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`renderers/esp32_gray_bin`**: 4-bpp linear grayscale packed
  buffer for IT8951-driven greyscale panels, primarily the Seeed
  reTerminal E1003 (10.3", 1872×1404, 16-level grayscale). Composition
  PNG in, raw packed .bin out (`width * height / 2` bytes; row-major,
  top-left origin, non-mirrored; high nibble = LEFT pixel, low nibble
  = RIGHT pixel; nibble value 0x0 = black, 0xF = white). Same
  8-mode dither list + contrast knob as `esp32_bin`; the dither
  pipeline runs against a 16-entry linear gray palette so
  Floyd-Steinberg produces smooth photographic gradients on the
  panel's genuine 16 grays rather than the 1-bit alternation
  `esp32_bw_bin` would give.
- **`app.quantizer.pack_to_panel_bin_4bpp_gray`**: the underlying
  packer that powers `esp32_gray_bin`. Byte contract asserted in-
  function (`width % 2 == 0`, image already at target dims, output
  length exactly `width * height / 2`) and covered by four unit tests
  in the renderer's smoke suite.

### Changed

- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1003.json` now routes through
  `esp32_client` + `esp32_gray_bin` (native 4-bpp grayscale path)
  instead of `trmnl_client` + `trmnl_png` (TRMNL BYOS 1-bit PNG
  path).** The unified `tesserae-device-firmware` ESP-IDF build
  supersedes the TRMNL BYOS workaround for this panel, unlocking the
  full 16 grays the E1003's IT8951 controller can render. Panel dims
  swapped from 1404×1872 portrait to 1872×1404 landscape to match
  the firmware's native orientation (which handles any physical
  mount-side flip itself). Same shape as the E1001/E1002/E1004
  migrations in v0.64.52 and v0.64.54.

## [0.64.56], 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **`scripts/pi-client-cloud-init.yaml` no longer shells out to
  `install.sh`.** The client's `install.sh` was written for
  interactive use and its internal `sudo` calls need a controlling
  terminal, which cloud-init's `runcmd` can't provide, so the whole
  install step silently failed on real first-boot. The yaml now does
  the equivalent work directly:
  - Apt-installs the runtime deps (python3, python3-venv,
    python3-dev, build-essential, libopenjp2-7, libtiff6) via
    cloud-init's `packages:` list.
  - Enables SPI + I²C via cloud-init's native `rpi.interfaces`
    block (no `raspi-config nonint` shell-out).
  - Appends `dtoverlay=spi0-0cs` to `/boot/firmware/config.txt` via
    a `write_files` entry.
  - Clones `tesserae-device-pi-bin`, builds the venv, pip-installs
    the client + `inky[rpi]` extras as the `tesserae` user via
    `su -c '...' tesserae`.
  - Symlinks `/usr/local/bin/tesserae-pi-bin-client` and installs the
    systemd unit inline (same `[Unit]/[Service]/[Install]` shape
    the client's `install-service.sh` used to write).
- **Per-flash settings moved from `user-data` edits to `meta-data`
  variables** using cloud-init's jinja2 template preprocessor
  (`## template: jinja` header). Both `server_url` and `panel model`
  now come out of `meta-data` via `{{ ds.meta_data.server_url }}` and
  `{{ ds.meta_data.model }}` references. Per-flash workflow becomes:
  copy the yaml unchanged, edit two lines of meta-data, boot.
- **`docs/quickstart/pi-inky-cloud-init.md`** updated to reflect the
  meta-data flow and to add a troubleshooting row for the "literal
  `{{ ds.meta_data.server_url }}` in config.toml" mode (missing
  jinja header).

## [0.64.55], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **`scripts/pi-client-cloud-init.yaml` left `/home/tesserae` owned
  by root.** cloud-init runs `write_files` before `users` when the
  home directory is created in the same run, so the pre-written
  `.config/tesserae-pi-bin-client/config.toml` (and its parent
  directories) landed owned by root. The `chown` in `runcmd` only
  covered the `.config` leaf, missing the intermediate parent dirs.
  Chowning `/home/tesserae` from the top level catches everything
  `write_files` planted plus anything the subsequent user-creation
  step populates. Reported and traced against a real first-boot on
  Pi OS Lite.

## [0.64.54], 2026-07-01

### Changed

- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1001.json` now routes through
  `esp32_bw_client` + `esp32_bw_bin` (native mono path) instead of
  `trmnl_client` + `trmnl_png` (TRMNL BYOS path).** Same pattern as
  the E1002/E1004 migration in v0.64.52. The unified
  `tesserae-device-firmware` ESP-IDF build streams frame bytes
  straight to the panel framebuffer without any on-device image
  decode, so it needs the raw 1-bpp packed buffer (48000 bytes for
  800×480, MSB=leftmost pixel, bit-set=white) that `esp32_bw_bin`
  already produces byte-for-byte. Users who intentionally flashed
  TRMNL BYOS firmware on an E1001 can add a custom hardware manifest
  that pins the `trmnl_client` protocol.

## [0.64.53], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Dockerfile was missing `COPY hardware/`**, so Docker + Home
  Assistant App installs shipped the code that reads the hardware
  catalog but not the catalog files themselves. Effect: every
  hardware-catalog-defined kind (all the vendor SKUs under
  `hardware/<vendor>/<model>.json`) was invisible in the Add Device
  kind dropdown, and `/api/v1/device/discover` rejected every matching
  firmware `kind` string with "unknown device kind '...'". Native
  git-clone installs weren't affected because they inherit the whole
  source tree. The fix is a one-line addition to the Dockerfile;
  rebuild the image / bump the HA App to pick it up.

## [0.64.52], 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`hardware/waveshare/waveshare_133e6.json`**: Waveshare 13.3" Spectra
  E6 (ESP32-S3-WROOM-2-N32R16V), 1200×1600 portrait, dual-SPI panel,
  routed through `esp32_client` + `esp32_bin`. Pairs with the
  `tesserae-device-firmware` ESP-IDF unified firmware build's
  `boards/waveshare_133e6.h` target.
- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1004.json`**: Seeed reTerminal E1004,
  13.3" 6-colour Spectra 6 (1200×1600 portrait) on an ESP32-S3.
  Routes through `esp32_client` + `esp32_bin`. Pairs with the
  unified firmware's `boards/seeed_reterminal_e1004.h` target.

### Changed

- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1002.json` now routes through
  `esp32_client` + `esp32_bin` (native path) instead of
  `trmnl_client` + `trmnl_png_color` (TRMNL BYOS path).** The E1002
  is now a Tesserae-native-firmware SKU by default; the unified
  `tesserae-device-firmware` ESP-IDF build supersedes the TRMNL
  BYOS-flashed workaround for this panel. Anyone who intentionally
  flashed TRMNL BYOS firmware on an E1002 can add a custom hardware
  manifest that pins `renderers: ["trmnl_png_color"]` on the
  `trmnl_client` protocol; the `trmnl_png_color` renderer stays in
  the tree for that case and for future colour TRMNL BYOS panels.

Palette nibble mapping in `esp32_bin` matches the unified firmware's
`EPD_COL_*` constants byte-for-byte (black=0x0, white=0x1, yellow=0x2,
red=0x3, blue=0x5, green=0x6; 0x4 and 0x7 reserved), so a frame packed
by `esp32_bin` paints without any on-device translation.

## [0.64.51], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Pimoroni Inky Impression 4" hardware manifest carried the wrong
  panel dimensions.** The current shipping SKU (PIM789) is 600×400
  Spectra 6; the manifest declared 640×400. Corrected in
  `hardware/pimoroni/inky_impression_4.json`.
- **Pi-client cloud-init's `[mqtt]` section read as required config
  even for REST setups.** Rewrote the comments so the block is
  clearly flagged as "only used when transport_mode = 'mqtt';
  ignored for the default REST setup" and each field's purpose is
  spelled out inline. No functional change, the block was already
  inert for REST users; the yaml just didn't say so plainly.

### Added

- **`hardware/pimoroni/inky_impression_4_acep.json`**: legacy 4"
  Inky Impression variant at 640×400 with the 7-colour ACeP gamut.
  Pre-dates the Spectra 6 refresh Pimoroni now ships under the
  same product name; user-owned examples still exist in the wild.
  Description explicitly points users at `pimoroni_inky_4` for the
  current Spectra 6 SKU so the two don't get confused during
  pairing.

## [0.64.50], 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Debug & diagnostics section on every device card
  (Settings → Devices → device).** Collapsed by default; expand to
  see the Tesserae version the server is running, the resolved
  device kind, the renderer clone ids the push pipeline will use,
  the panel block (dims + gamut + orientation + underscan),
  transport + MQTT topic bindings (when applicable), the on-disk
  instance file path, and the raw instance JSON with secrets
  (access_token, `_secret`-suffixed keys) masked to `***` so the
  block is safe to screenshot for a support thread. Answers the
  recurring "is the panel actually rendering with the renderer I
  think it is" question in one glance, and lets an operator confirm
  a prod server is on the release that ships a specific fix.

## [0.64.49], 2026-07-01

### Added

- **`renderers/trmnl_png_color`**: colour-panel renderer for TRMNL BYOS
  devices. Composition PNG in, indexed PNG out with a gamut-selected
  palette (Waveshare E6 for Spectra 6, Inky 7-colour for ACeP,
  1-bit for mono, Waveshare E6 fallback for unlabelled colour panels).
  Ships on the same `tesserae/{device}/frame/trmnl` topic pattern
  as the mono `trmnl_png` renderer, so devices route through the
  same /api/display path with only the output format differing per
  SKU. Server-side Floyd-Steinberg against the panel's palette
  produces the smoothest gradients the target firmware can render
  (verified against `usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware` E1002_fix branch's
  `png_draw_6clr` / `GetSpectraPixel` decoders).
- **Per-hardware `renderers` override in the hardware catalog
  schema.** Hardware entries under `hardware/<vendor>/<sku>.json`
  can now declare `"renderers": ["..."]` to replace the protocol's
  default renderer list, used when the same wire protocol drives
  panels with meaningfully different output formats.
  `_derive_manifest` picks up the override at kind-registration
  time; the common case (SKU inherits from protocol) is unchanged.

### Changed

- **Seeed reTerminal E1002** (`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1002.json`)
  now routes through `trmnl_png_color` instead of the default
  1-bit `trmnl_png`. Panel gamut relabelled from `acep_7colour` to
  `spectra_6` to match what the TRMNL firmware for that board
  actually targets. Colour output is untested on real hardware
  pending device arrival; the plumbing is verified end-to-end via
  the renderer + hardware catalog test suites.

## [0.64.48], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Per-device battery offset (v0.64.47) only reached the
  `/devices/battery` dashboard and the chart; the topbar battery
  indicator, the popover detail list, the bundled `device_battery`
  widget, and the Home Assistant discovery sensors kept showing the
  raw firmware-reported value.** Each of those is its own read site
  for `parsed.battery_pct` / `parsed.battery_mv` from the
  `DEVICE_STATUS` cache; the offset only landed on two of them. Now
  applied consistently across all five so a saved offset reflects
  everywhere a human (or a Home Assistant automation) sees the
  battery for that device.

## [0.64.47], 2026-07-01

### Added

- **Per-device battery display offset (Settings → Devices → device
  card).** Two signed integers, mV and percent, applied at read time
  to align the displayed battery with a voltmeter measurement.
  Voltage offset re-derives the percent from a LiPo curve so a
  calibrated 4.20 V cell that the device reports as 3.85 V now reads
  as 100% on the dashboard. The percent offset adds on top for the
  band-aid "UI says 85, voltmeter says 100, add 15" case. Both at
  zero drops the override entirely. Raw firmware readings stay
  untouched in the SQLite history store so a recalibration tomorrow
  doesn't lose the historical record; only the displayed values
  (dashboard, /devices/battery chart, HA discovery sensors) shift.
- **Time-to-fully-charged projection on /devices/battery cards.**
  When the latest samples show sustained charging (positive slope on
  the trailing monotonic segment, above the existing magnitude
  threshold), the empty-projection tile flips to "Full in Xh / X
  days". Gated by the same sustained-segment regression that drives
  the days-to-empty projection, so transient ADC wobble doesn't
  toggle the indicator. The `Prediction` dataclass gains a
  `days_to_full: float | None` field; downstream consumers can opt
  in to the new value.
- **"Clear battery history" button per device on /devices/battery.**
  Wipes every recorded sample for one device only, leaving other
  devices' histories alone. Gated by a JS confirm so an accidental
  click can't drop the data. Useful after a recalibration, a
  battery swap, or a device factory-reset where the historical curve
  no longer reflects the current cell.

### Changed

- `app.device_loader.load_instance_file` now carries through the
  optional `battery_offset` block from a device instance manifest
  (alongside the existing `quiet_hours` carry-through), so the
  per-device override survives the hot-reload that fires when any
  device-card subsection is saved.

## [0.64.46], 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **Settings → Devices Dismiss flashed a misleading "broker offline"
  error in REST-only installs.** The dismiss handler always tried to
  publish an empty retained payload to clear an MQTT-side heartbeat;
  in a REST-only setup the transport isn't connected, so the publish
  raised and surfaced as an error even though the in-memory dismiss
  had succeeded cleanly. The handler now guards on
  `transport().connected` and only attempts (and surfaces) the
  retained-clear step when a broker is actually in play. (#38)
- **`circuitpython_generic` is now a real device kind.** The client
  protocol docs cited `kind: "circuitpython_generic"` in the
  discover / register examples but no matching plugin shipped, so a
  CircuitPython firmware following the spec literally got rejected
  at registration. Ships a new `devices/circuitpython_generic/`
  kind (pairs with the existing `circuitpython_png` renderer; v1
  REST `parse_status` for the standard battery / rssi / ip / sleep
  fields with stringy-number coercion; configurable sleep cadence).
  Docs gained a note that `kind` values are server-side plugin ids
  and that board-specific kinds can ship alongside the generic
  catch-all. (#39)
- **Settings → System Updates card showed a stale version from the
  latest published GitHub Release.** The card hit `/releases/latest`,
  which only knows about published Releases; if tags get pushed
  faster than Releases get cut (the new weekly Release cadence
  introduces exactly this gap), the card surfaced an older version
  than the footer. The card now reads `/tags` newest-first as the
  canonical version source, with the Release page URL constructed
  from the tag so GitHub auto-redirects to the published Release
  view when one exists. One API call, single source of truth,
  matches the footer. (#40)

### Changed

- Releases will now be cut on a weekly cadence (Friday afternoon
  Melbourne) rather than per-tag. Tags continue to be pushed for
  every change so the in-app updater and `pip install -e .` users
  still pull the freshest code; Releases batch the week's changes
  into a curated notes view.

## [0.64.45], 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`scripts/pi-client-cloud-init.yaml`**: zero-touch install for a
  Raspberry Pi driving a Pimoroni Inky panel. Flash Raspberry Pi OS
  Lite via Pi Imager, drop the yaml into the boot partition as
  `user-data`, edit the Tesserae server URL and Inky panel model,
  insert + power on. cloud-init creates a `tesserae` user with
  `gpio` + `spi` group membership, pre-writes the client config,
  clones `tesserae-device-pi-bin`, runs its `install.sh
  --non-interactive` (apt deps + raspi-config SPI/I2C +
  dtoverlay=spi0-0cs + venv + pip install + systemd unit), and
  reboots so SPI / I2C take effect. After the reboot the daemon
  starts on its own and announces to the Tesserae server's
  Discovered strip for one-click registration.
- **[`docs/quickstart/pi-inky-cloud-init.md`](quickstart/pi-inky-cloud-init.md)**:
  step-by-step walkthrough of the cloud-init path, including the
  Pi Imager flow, the two values to edit before flashing, the
  pairing flow on the Tesserae server side, and a troubleshooting
  table for the usual first-boot failure modes (I2C didn't enable,
  spi0-0cs overlay missing, server URL unreachable).
- **[`docs/quickstart/pi-inky.md`](quickstart/pi-inky.md)** gains a
  callout linking to the cloud-init path for fresh SD cards.
- **[`mkdocs.yml`](mkdocs.yml)** Hardware quickstart nav extended
  with the cloud-init sibling between the manual Pi + Inky entry
  and the Pi Pico variant.

## [0.64.44], 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`renderers/circuitpython_png/`**: new server-side renderer that
  emits a palette-quantized indexed PNG at the panel's exact dims.
  Targets CircuitPython clients on memory-constrained
  microcontrollers (Pico-W, ESP32-S3 / -C3 / -C6, nRF52840) where
  the nibble-packed `.bin` format isn't viable: there's no
  general-purpose decoder for it in the CircuitPython ecosystem, and
  the packed buffer plus a decode scratch buffer would exhaust SRAM
  on a Pico-W. Output is a true indexed PNG (mode "P") that
  `adafruit_imageload` mounts directly with minimal RAM. Palette is
  selected from the bound panel's gamut: `mono` -> 1-bit black/white,
  `spectra_6` / `waveshare_e6` -> 6-colour Spectra 6, `acep_7colour`
  / `inky_7colour` -> 7-colour ACeP, anything else falls back to
  Spectra 6 nominal. Same per-device picture-quality knobs as
  `trmnl_png` (dither mode + pre-dither contrast). Smoke tests
  cover the indexed-mode invariant, the per-gamut palette
  membership, and the flip path. Backlog item closed:
  [#34](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/34).

## [0.64.43], 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **Marketplace Browse grid now uses `grid-auto-rows: 1fr`** so cards
  in the same row share the tallest card's height. v0.64.42 capped
  the folder chip list at 3 + "+N more", which fixed the most
  egregious case (a 5-folder bundle wrapping to 3 rows), but
  description-length variation and the "+N more" tail still wrapping
  to a second chip row meant a small height differential remained.
  Equal-height rows close that gap entirely; the action footer
  already has `margin-top: auto` so it floats to the bottom of any
  card grown to match its taller neighbour. Same pattern most app-
  store catalogs use.

## [0.64.42], 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **Marketplace Browse cards now cap the bundled-folder list at 3
  with a "+N more" tail** instead of rendering every folder name
  inline. Bundles with many folders (e.g. AFL Bundle at 5, AI Brief
  at 4) were pushing their cards visibly taller than single-folder
  neighbours in the grid, since the chips wrapped onto extra rows
  while CSS Grid only equalises width, not height. Truncated chips
  carry a `title=` tooltip listing the hidden folder names so power
  users can still inspect the full bundle without clicking through
  to the source repo. Tail rendered as a muted italic chip; the
  three visible folder names still cover the bundle's identity at a
  glance.

## [0.64.41], 2026-06-29

### Added

- **[`docs/quickstart/seeed-reterminal.md`](quickstart/seeed-reterminal.md)
  gains a Per-model references section** under the model header table,
  with two links:
    - **E1002**: the [colour-for-calendars discussion on r/trmnl](https://www.reddit.com/r/trmnl/comments/1ucr8b2/color_for_calendars_is_here/),
      covering practical layout patterns for the ACeP 7-colour gamut.
    - **E1004**: the upstream firmware PR chain. Original bring-up in
      [usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware#410](https://github.com/usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware/pull/410)
      (now closed); active PR is
      [usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware#445](https://github.com/usetrmnl/trmnl-firmware/pull/445),
      which rebases that work onto `main` with build hardening and adds
      onboard SHT4x temperature / humidity reporting through the
      existing `SENSORS` header.

## [0.64.40], 2026-06-29

### Added

- **Per-hardware quickstart guides under [`docs/quickstart/`](quickstart/index.md).**
  Eight family-grouped pages mirroring the
  [tesserae.ink](https://tesserae.ink) quickstart format (four numbered
  steps: install / pair / compose / schedule), one per supported
  hardware family:
    - Raspberry Pi + Pimoroni Inky Impression.
    - Pi Pico Plus 2 W + Inky 13.3".
    - Waveshare 13.3" Spectra 6 (ESP32-S3).
    - Waveshare 7.3" PhotoPainter (ESP32-S3).
    - Waveshare 4.2" B/W (ESP32).
    - TRMNL OG / TRMNL X (stock firmware, no flashing).
    - Seeed reTerminal E-Series (E1001 / E1002 / E1003 / E1004).
    - Seeed XIAO 7.5" ePaper Panel.
    - Kindle Paperwhite + KOReader.
  Plus a [Quickstart overview](quickstart/index.md) that groups the
  guides by hardware family. README and `mkdocs.yml` updated to surface
  the new section. The existing `docs/install/clients.md` reference
  page stays as the protocol-level depth doc; quickstarts are the
  consumer-oriented entry point.

## [0.64.39], 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1003.json` no longer claims the device
  ships speaking TRMNL BYOS out of the box.** The reTerminal E1003 ships
  with Seeed's own ESP32-S3 UI; the BYOS path requires reflashing with
  TRMNL firmware first, which is what the README has always said but
  the manifest's `description` and `notes_md` previously contradicted.
  The worked example in [`docs/dev/adding-hardware.md`](dev/adding-hardware.md)
  inherits the fix since it inlines the same JSON.

## [0.64.38], 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Six hardware catalog manifests for previously-undeclared SKUs.**
  Each routes to an existing protocol so no Python changes are required;
  the Settings UI's kind picker now offers the SKU under its vendor with
  the correct panel preselected.
    - `hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1001.json` (7.5" mono, 800x480),
      protocol `trmnl_client`, model header `reTerminal E1001`.
    - `hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1002.json` (7.3" ACeP 7-colour,
      800x480), protocol `trmnl_client`, model header `reTerminal E1002`.
    - `hardware/seeed/xiao_75.json` (XIAO 7.5" mono, 800x480),
      protocol `trmnl_client`.
    - `hardware/pimoroni/inky_impression_4.json` (640x400 Spectra 6),
      protocol `pi_bin_client`.
    - `hardware/waveshare/wave42_bw.json` (4.2" B/W, 400x300),
      protocol `esp32_bw_client`.
    - `hardware/trmnl/x.json` (10.3" mono, 1872x1404), protocol
      `trmnl_client`, model header `x`.
  None are flagged as verified on real hardware yet; each manifest's
  `notes_md` says so explicitly. The intent is to remove the "drop a
  JSON" step gating first-touch testing so a tester with the hardware
  can pair and report status without a code change.

## [0.64.37], 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **LXC docs and cloud-init.yaml now use `images:debian/trixie/cloud`**
  on the cloud-init launch command. The slim `images:debian/trixie`
  image used in the manual-setup section does not include cloud-init,
  so the user-data block was silently ignored. The /cloud variant ships
  with cloud-init pre-installed and is the right pick for any automated
  provisioning. Manual-setup instructions keep the slim image since
  cloud-init is not involved there.
- **Hardware sizing note in `docs/install/lxc.md`** updated to mark 2GB
  as confirmed (about 1GB headroom after install) rather than testing
  pending. Confirmed by a community installer on a CM4 2GB.
- **Added a troubleshooting tip** for MicroCloud setups where
  `microcloud init` does not auto-detect NVMe / dedicated storage,
  documenting the `--storage <pool-name>` flag on `lxc launch` plus
  the `lxc storage list` lookup.

## [0.64.36], 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **weather_forecast / weather_hourly label stayed stale on cache hit.**
  The v0.64.16 fix overlaid the user-edited ``label`` onto the cached
  blob before returning, but missed the duplicate ``place`` field that
  the newer variants paint. A location rename on the same
  ``(lat, lon, units[, hours])`` cache key updated ``label`` but the
  variant template still showed the stale ``place``, so the rename
  appeared not to stick until the user toggled units or picked a new
  city (which changed the cache key). Now both fields are overlaid
  together.
- **news_rss and news_wikipedia_otd cache key was incomplete.**
  ``max_items`` was used to slice the result but wasn't part of the
  cache key, so changing it in the editor served the prior fetch's
  slice for up to the 10-minute TTL. Added ``max_items`` to the cache
  filename so a size change refetches at the new size.

## [0.64.35], 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **README's inline "Adding a new SKU" section removed** in favour of
  the dedicated [docs/dev/adding-hardware.md](dev/adding-hardware.md)
  page added in 0.64.33. The contribution path stays discoverable via
  a new link in the Full Documentation callout at the top of the
  README.

## [0.64.34], 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **[`docs/widgets/gallery.md`](widgets/gallery.md)** regenerated, was
  stale at 30 widget cards while the actual bundled set is 33. Re-ran
  `scripts/gen_widget_gallery.py` to refresh the page from the live
  plugin manifests.
- **[`docs/credits.md`](credits.md)** bundled-fonts table missing
  three OFL entries: Archivo Narrow, Bodoni Moda, and Jost. All three
  live under `plugins/fonts_core/static/` and ship with the host. Now
  listed with their designers.

## [0.64.33], 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **README cut from 379 to 138 lines.** Hardware lineup tables now
  carry per-row Client + Status columns with vendor product page
  links, covering the Seeed reTerminal E Series, TRMNL OG / X, the
  TRMNL 7.5" OG DIY Kit, the XIAO 7.5" ePaper panel, the Pimoroni
  Inky Impression lineup, and the Waveshare ESP32 panels.
  Feature lists, install variants, and detailed compatibility
  tables moved to the docs site.
- **[`docs/install/clients.md`](install/clients.md)** adds REST in
  the Transport column for the clients that support it (`pi-png`,
  `photopainter-7.3-bin`), drops the dead `tesserae-trmnl-client`
  reference for direct links to TRMNL's firmware repo and KOReader's
  `trmnl-display` plugin, and adds the missing
  `tesserae-device-pico-bin` row.

### Added

- **[`docs/dev/adding-hardware.md`](dev/adding-hardware.md)** walks
  contributors through the hardware-catalog schema with the bundled
  reTerminal E1003 entry as a worked example. Covers the two-tier
  protocol-plus-SKU model, when to use the catalog vs writing a new
  protocol folder, the schema reference, how catalog kinds register
  alongside folder kinds, backwards-compat rules (folder wins on
  conflict, `deprecated_aliases`, orphan handling), and the
  per-protocol `protocol_config` notes.

### Fixed

- **`hardware/seeed/reterminal_e1003.json`** product URL corrected to
  the actual Seeed Studio listing (`p-6731`, was `p-6533`).

## [0.64.32], 2026-06-27

### Added

- **Hardware catalog: data-only SKU definitions.** Adding an e-paper
  SKU that uses one of the existing protocol-level device kinds (TRMNL
  BYOS, MQTT bin, MQTT PNG, REST pull) no longer requires forking a
  ``devices/<id>/`` folder. Drop a JSON file under
  ``hardware/<vendor>/<model>.json`` declaring the panel block, vendor
  metadata, and any protocol-specific defaults; the loader walks
  ``hardware/`` after the folder-based discovery and registers each
  SKU as a kind that borrows the protocol's parse/validate hooks but
  carries its own manifest. Folder-defined kinds always win on id
  conflict so existing installs see no behaviour change. Schema lives
  at ``schema/hardware.schema.json``; the catalog supports a
  ``protocol_config`` free-form block (each protocol decides what's
  valid there), a ``config_schema_extends`` additive merge over the
  protocol's config form, and ``deprecated_aliases`` so a renamed kind
  can keep resolving for legacy device-instance files.

## [0.64.31], 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Duplicate dashboard.** A copy button on the dashboards list and in
  the page editor header clones the current dashboard (cells, theme,
  style, font, device bindings, panel override, per-cell options) under
  ``"<name> copy"``, falling back to ``"<name> copy 2"`` /
  ``"<name> copy 3"`` on name collision. Page id and every cell id are
  regenerated so the copy is fully independent of the source, useful
  for iterating on a layout without risk to a dashboard already bound to
  a panel. Per [discussions#6](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/discussions/6).

## [0.64.30], 2026-06-26

### Added

- **[`docs/install/lxc.md`](install/lxc.md)** documents installing
  Tesserae inside an LXC container, covering Proxmox VE for x86
  homelab hosts and Ubuntu MicroCloud for arm64 Raspberry Pi. Lists
  the package set, user setup, and the data directory layout, and
  notes the LAN-only auth model with a VPN-for-remote-access
  pointer.
- **[`scripts/cloud-init.yaml`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/blob/main/scripts/cloud-init.yaml)**
  automates the same install via cloud-init. Drops in as the
  `user-data` field for MicroCloud / Proxmox / any cloud-init-aware
  image. Installs the venv, downloads Playwright's bundled Chromium
  so webpage widgets work out of the box, and registers the
  systemd unit.

## [0.64.29], 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **[``docs/dev/openapi.md``](dev/openapi.md)** gains an install
  block showing ``pip install "openapi-generator-cli[jdk4py]"`` for
  users who don't have a system JDK on PATH (the generator itself
  is a Java program; ``jdk4py`` is a pip extra that bundles a JDK
  runtime). Also adds a short note flagging that
  openapi-generator's output is heavyweight by design and a poor
  fit for memory-constrained MCU targets, where a hand-written
  minimal client against the spec is the better path.

## [0.64.28], 2026-06-25

### Added

- `pillow-heif` added to the host dependencies. Registers a HEIF
  decoder with Pillow at import time so any picture-family widget
  can transcode iPhone HEIC originals to JPEG on the proxy path.
  Wheel-bundled `libheif` on every tier-1 platform, no system
  package step required.

## [0.64.27], 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Settings → About**, a new tab carrying the install's project
  meta (version, license, source / docs / discussions links), a
  prompt to fill out a six-question Tally survey on how people
  use Tesserae (since v0.64.22 ripped phone-home telemetry,
  asking is the only signal channel left), and a "Support the
  project" card linking to GitHub Sponsors. Survey is anonymous,
  optional per question. Three cards, no forms, no manifest
  sections; the route passes the version and the two outbound
  URLs in.

### Removed

- **"Test broker connection" diagnostics card on Settings →
  Server.** The card was rarely used now that REST is the default
  transport, and sitting next to the much taller Session card it
  produced a visible height mismatch at the bottom of the page.
  The underlying ``auth.diagnostics_test_broker`` route is left
  intact (no broken bookmarks); the UI surface is gone.

## [0.64.26], 2026-06-25

### Changed

- **README badges restyled to ``for-the-badge`` with Phosphor
  icons.** Swapped from ``flat-square`` plain badges to the bolder
  ``for-the-badge`` style, with each badge's logo loaded inline as
  a base64-encoded Phosphor regular SVG (``scales`` for license,
  ``tag`` for the latest release, ``check-circle`` for CI,
  ``chats-circle`` for Discussions, ``cloud-arrow-up`` for the
  Codespaces launcher, ``heart`` for Sponsor). Keeps the brand
  consistent with the rest of the project (Tesserae's UI already
  uses Phosphor end-to-end via the bundled woff2 fonts under
  [``static/icons/phosphor/``](static/icons/phosphor/)).

## [0.64.25], 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **One stale encrypted secret no longer cascade-fails the entire
  ``get_section()`` call.** Follow-up to
  [#29](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/29): RealGandy
  tried the v0.64.24 workaround (delete the wrapped HA token from
  ``data/core/settings.json``, restart, re-paste) and still got
  the same ``AES-GCM authentication failed`` error. The cause was
  that another plugin's older ``*_secret`` value (likely
  ``spotify``, ``github``, ``marketplace``, or similar, anything
  configured before the key changed) was still wrapped under the
  pre-rotation key. ``_unwrap_tree`` walked the plugins section
  in dict-iteration order and bailed out the moment it hit the
  first failing decryption, before it ever reached the
  freshly-rewrapped HA token. So re-entering one plugin's secret
  appeared to do nothing.

  ``_unwrap_tree`` is now tolerant of per-value failures: each
  bad value is logged + replaced with an empty string, the rest
  of the section walk continues. Plugins downstream observe the
  empty string the same way they'd observe "never set" and fall
  through to their own "not configured" sentinels (the
  v0.64.24 "re-enter the secret" entity-picker banner, the
  plugin's own ``is_configured()`` short-circuit, etc.). One
  broken secret can't take out the rest of the section any more.
  The manifest-aware ``get_for_runtime`` path stays strict so a
  caller asking for a specific token still gets a loud error
  rather than an empty string and a downstream 401.

  Net effect for someone in RealGandy's spot: they can delete
  every ``*_secret`` value in ``plugins.*`` (or just the ones
  for plugins they care about) in one pass and re-enter them as
  they need to, without the cascade making each individual
  re-entry look like it did nothing.

## [0.64.24], 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Editor entity picker now surfaces a re-enter banner when a
  plugin's stored secret can't be decrypted, instead of silently
  rendering an empty dropdown.** Reported by RealGandy in
  [#29](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/29) against a
  Docker compose install where the HA long-lived token had been
  added under one ``TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY`` (or session-derived key)
  and was being read under another. ``_materialize_cell_options``
  in [``app/page_routes.py``](app/page_routes.py) had a
  catch-all that swallowed every exception from
  ``plugin.choices(...)`` and rendered ``[]``, which surfaced as
  "no entities to select" with zero indication of the cause.

  ``SecretBoxError`` is now caught specifically and the picker
  shows a single sentinel choice with the label
  ``"Stored secret for <plugin name> can't be decrypted, re-enter
  it under Settings → Plugins → <plugin name>"``. Other exception
  types still fall through to the empty-list treatment so a real
  network timeout or upstream outage doesn't mis-blame
  decryption.

  Workaround for any user hitting this on their existing data:
  stop the container, delete the ``plugins.<plugin>.token_secret``
  (or other ``_secret``-suffixed) key from
  ``data/core/settings.json``, restart, and re-paste the secret
  in Settings → Plugins. The re-wrap uses the current key so
  decryption succeeds on every subsequent run. The root cause
  (which key resolution diverged across runs) is documented in
  the comment thread on issue #29.

## [0.64.23], 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **Weather widget location reset on any reload-on-change save.**
  Changing an unrelated cell's plugin / panel preset / theme on
  the page editor triggers a save-all loop that POSTs every
  cell's form before reloading the page. Cells using the
  ``location_search`` field would come back blank from that
  reload even though the user hadn't touched them. Root cause was
  in [``templates/_components.html:228``](templates/_components.html#L228):
  the ``location_search_field`` macro rendered the saved location
  via ``value | tojson``. ``tojson`` marks its output safe (it's
  intended for ``<script>`` context, where ``"`` is fine), so the
  JSON's literal ``"`` characters were written verbatim into the
  ``value="..."`` HTML attribute and terminated the attribute at
  the first inner quote. The browser parsed the attribute as
  ``value="{"`` and ``.value`` came back as the single character
  ``{``. The save-all loop POSTed ``opt_location={``,
  ``_coerce_cell_option`` JSON-failed and fell back to ``{}``,
  and the cell location was wiped on the next reload.
  ``|forceescape`` (which re-escapes even Markup-tagged strings,
  ``|e`` short-circuits on Markup) now sits in the chain so the
  inner quotes become ``&quot;`` and the attribute survives.
- **Regression test in [``tests/test_location_search.py``](tests/test_location_search.py)**
  renders the macro through Flask, parses the result with
  ``html.parser`` (which decodes entities the way a browser
  does), and asserts the hidden input's ``value`` attribute
  round-trips through ``json.loads`` back to the original dict.
  Catches any future regression that re-introduces an unescaped
  ``tojson`` directly into an HTML attribute.

  Caught by inspecting the actual POST body that triggered the
  reset, the ``Form Data`` showed ``opt_location={``, which made
  the root cause obvious in hindsight.

## [0.64.22], 2026-06-24

### Removed

- **App-side phone-home telemetry, in full.** The PostHog integration
  that fired ``app.started`` / ``app.heartbeat`` / ``update.applied``
  / ``theme.user_created`` events through the ``t.dmello.io`` reverse
  proxy is gone. Deleted ``app/telemetry.py``, the
  ``app.config["TELEMETRY"]`` lifecycle, the heartbeat-enrichment
  closure (fleet shape + activity counters), the Settings → Server →
  App "Send anonymous usage telemetry" toggle, the onboarding wizard
  "Help out" step, and the ``system_telemetry_test`` admin route.
  Tesserae now contacts no third party from the running server.

  Rationale: the reverse-proxy approach routed around user-installed
  ad-blockers (uBlock, Pi-hole, NextDNS lists), which is hard to
  defend regardless of intent. A self-hosted hobby project that
  ships zero phone-home is a more coherent privacy position than any
  opt-out toggle, and the recently-discovered post-startup
  enrichment bug (provider closure registered only when telemetry
  was enabled at boot, so users who opted in later sent bare
  heartbeats forever) confirmed the data was noisy enough to not be
  worth the maintenance.

  ``app/state/device_telemetry.py`` (per-device battery / RSSI /
  smart-sync state) is unrelated and **stays untouched**.

### Changed

- **Docs-site analytics are now cookieless.** Added
  ``persistence: 'memory'`` to the PostHog init in
  ``overrides/main.html`` so the docs site stops writing the
  ``ph_...`` cookie / localStorage entry. Page views, country,
  referrers, and time-of-day continue to work; unique-visitor
  counts will inflate (every navigation gets a fresh
  ``distinct_id``) but that's the metric the project cares about
  least. No GDPR / ePrivacy consent banner is required when no
  persistent identifier is written.
- **Privacy doc rewritten.** ``docs/privacy.md`` no longer
  describes opt-out telemetry defaults; it now states plainly that
  Tesserae sends no app-side phone-home and describes the
  cookieless docs analytics separately. ``mkdocs.yml`` nav entry
  renamed from "Privacy & telemetry" to "Privacy".

## [0.64.21], 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- **``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/log`` no longer doubles newlines
  between traceback lines.** v0.64.20's list-input handling did a
  naive ``"\n".join(...)`` over the entries, which works perfectly
  for hand-crafted lists but not for the most common producer of
  list-shaped tracebacks, ``traceback.format_exception()``, whose
  entries already end in ``\n``. The result was a blank line
  between every traceback row on the Events page. Now strips one
  trailing ``\n`` per line before joining, so both shapes produce
  the same clean output. Suggested by Bernhard
  ([@bablokb](https://github.com/bablokb)) right after v0.64.20
  shipped.

## [0.64.20], 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/log`` now accepts ``msg`` as either
  a string or a list of strings.** Memory-constrained MicroPython /
  CircuitPython clients can pass a pre-split traceback (e.g.
  ``traceback.format_exception()`` output) directly instead of
  allocating a single joined string on-device, which is most useful
  exactly when the device is mid-exception and the heap is
  tightest. Lists are joined server-side with ``\n`` so the
  EventLog still holds one string per row.
- **Raised the ``msg`` cap from 512 B to 4 KB.** A typical Python
  traceback is 1-3 KB and was being silently clipped under the old
  cap; 4 KB covers them without giving a noisy client room to
  flood the log one entry at a time.

Both changes are backwards compatible. Existing firmware sending
``msg`` as a string sees no behavioural change; only the cap moved,
which is a strict relaxation.

Suggested by Bernhard ([@bablokb](https://github.com/bablokb)) when
porting his CircuitPython client.

## [0.64.19], 2026-06-24

### Changed

- **REST-transport docs now lead with discover + admin Register,
  not the 6-digit pairing code.** In practice every REST device
  ends up bootstrapped through ``/api/v1/device/discover`` (firmware
  announces, device appears in the Discovered strip, admin clicks
  Register, token returns on the next poll), but our docs kept
  walking readers through the "generate a pairing code, type it
  into firmware" path as if it were the default. That was a path
  of resistance that nobody actually walks, and it made the REST
  transport read as fiddlier than it is. Rewrote
  [``docs/install/rest-transport.md``](install/rest-transport.md),
  [``docs/dev/client-protocol.md``](dev/client-protocol.md), and
  [``docs/dev/openapi.md``](dev/openapi.md) to foreground the
  zero-typed-credentials flow and demote pairing codes to a
  fallback callout for sealed appliances / BLE provisioning / kiosk
  modes where the admin can't be at the UI when the device boots.
  Both endpoints still exist; the OpenAPI spec is unchanged.

## [0.64.18], 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Docs page for the OpenAPI spec at [`docs/dev/openapi.md`](dev/openapi.md).**
  Walks through what the spec covers, what's deliberately not in it,
  copy-pasteable ``openapi-generator`` / ``kiota`` commands for
  Python / TS / Go / Rust, the six security schemes side-by-side,
  the bootstrap flow for a native REST client (MAC auto-claim vs
  pairing code), a worked cron + curl webhook example, and the
  versioning policy. Two buttons at the top open the spec live in
  Swagger Editor or Redoc with the file pre-loaded from
  raw.githubusercontent.com, so a reader can click through to the
  interactive reference without installing anything. Linked into
  the wiki nav under Client development alongside the existing
  client-protocol spec.

## [0.64.17], 2026-06-24

### Added

- **OpenAPI 3.0.3 spec at [`schema/openapi.yaml`](schema/openapi.yaml).**
  Covers the four machine-facing surfaces an external integrator
  would target: the native REST device API
  (``/api/v1/device/{frame,status,log,discover,register}``), the
  TRMNL-compatible BYOS endpoints (``/api/display``, ``/api/setup``,
  ``/api/log``, ``/api/log/level``), the webhook push hook
  (``/api/v1/push``), and the render-artifact routes
  (``/renders/<filename>``, ``/preview/<device_id>.png``,
  ``/mirror/<device_id>``), plus ``/healthz``. 14 paths, 17 schemas,
  6 security schemes. Validated by ``openapi-spec-validator``.
  Editor/settings/composer HTML routes and internal admin JSON are
  excluded by design; they aren't a stable external contract.
  Generators like ``openapi-generator-cli`` or ``kiota`` can produce
  client SDKs in arbitrary languages from this file.

### Fixed

- **Mypy on strict modules.** ``_coerce_cell_option``'s
  ``location_search`` branch passed ``parsed.get(key)`` straight
  into ``float()``, which the runtime ``contextlib.suppress`` happily
  absorbed but mypy flagged as ``Argument 1 to "float" has
  incompatible type "Any | None"``. Added an explicit ``None`` skip
  so the static check matches the runtime behaviour.

## [0.64.16], 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Weather + sunrise widget labels stayed stale until the cell's
  units (or any other cache-key field) changed.** The weather_now
  / weather_forecast / weather_hourly / weather_now_scenic /
  clock_sunrise_sunset widgets cache their upstream API response
  to disk under a key of ``(latitude, longitude[, units[, hours]])``
  for ``CACHE_TTL_S = 600`` seconds, and the cached blob *included*
  the ``label`` UI string. That meant editing the label (or picking
  a new city, which auto-fills the label) on the same coordinates
  short-circuited the fetch path: ``_resolved_options`` correctly
  produced ``options.label = "Berlin"``, but ``fetch()`` returned
  the stale cached dict with whatever label was baked in 10 minutes
  earlier. Toggling units changed the cache key, dodged the cache,
  and was the only way to surface the new label, which was the
  observed "label only updates after switching C/F" behaviour.
  Fixed by overlaying ``options.get("label", "")`` on every cache
  hit, before returning; the cached blob is still useful as an
  upstream-API memo but the UI string is treated as a live field.

## [0.64.15], 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Location pick didn't refresh the preview until a sibling
  field nudged.** The form-level ``input`` listener in
  ``editor.js`` has a ``_deferToBlur`` gate that early-returns
  for text-type inputs, so a synthetic ``input`` event dispatched
  on a text input (the sibling Label field that
  ``location_search`` auto-fills) didn't trigger
  ``schedulePreview``. Resulted in the label updating only after
  the user touched units or another non-text field. Now
  ``editor.js`` exposes a tiny global hook
  (``window.tesseraeSchedulePreview()``) that custom form-builder
  components call directly when they programmatically update an
  input value, bypassing the defer-to-blur gate. The location-
  search component uses it on every pick + clear.

### Changed

- **Visual polish on the ``location_search`` field.** The input
  now tints accent when a location is set (so a glance at the
  cell editor tells you whether a search has a value),
  placeholder copy tightened to "Search a city…", and the picked
  city renders as a small accent-bordered pill below the input
  with the resolved name + coordinates instead of a muted text
  line. JS dynamically rebuilds the pill on each pick / clear,
  so the live preview state stays in lock-step with what the
  editor shows even before the form has been saved.

## [0.64.14], 2026-06-23

### Changed

- **Location widgets simplified to two visible fields.** The cell
  editor for ``weather_now`` (v0.1.10), ``weather_forecast``
  (v0.1.7), ``weather_hourly`` (v0.2.4), ``weather_now_scenic``
  (v0.1.2), and ``clock_sunrise_sunset`` (v0.1.6) now shows only
  **Location** (search) and **Label** (auto-filled from the picked
  city, editable to "Home" or similar). The visible
  ``latitude`` / ``longitude`` override fields are gone; the
  location dict is the single source of truth.
- **JS auto-fills the Label input** when the user picks a result
  from the location search. The Label is wired into the editor's
  autosave + preview pickup so the title shows the picked city
  immediately. (Replaces the v0.64.12-v0.64.13 contract where the
  label was set server-side via ``_resolved_options`` promotion;
  the server-side promotion still fires for cases where a cell
  arrives via the API or a restored backup without the JS
  running.)

### Fixed

- **Weather widgets no longer silently render Melbourne weather.**
  ``_resolved_options`` lost its global-settings fallback (used to
  reach into Settings → Server → Latitude/Longitude when the cell
  itself had no coords) and the constant Melbourne coordinates.
  Cells without a picked location now return a friendly
  "Pick a location in the cell editor." error from ``fetch()``,
  surfaced by the widget client's existing error path.

### Why

A user-facing thread (Bernhard's #26, expanded on by Kayden after
the v0.64.12-13 ships) called out that the Melbourne label kept
re-appearing because the editor had three coupled location fields
(``latitude``, ``longitude``, ``label``) PLUS a hidden chain of
fallbacks reaching into the Settings page. Even when the user
picked a different city, the leftover override fields and the
silent Settings fallback could still inject Melbourne data. The
new shape has one path: pick a city, the label and the
coordinates come from that. Custom labels are an explicit
override of the city name on a single visible input.

### Backwards compatibility

Mostly backwards compatible:

- Existing cells that have a ``location`` dict picked are
  unaffected.
- Existing cells that used the old ``latitude`` / ``longitude``
  manual entry lose those values on next edit (the manifest no
  longer declares the fields, so the form-builder doesn't carry
  them through). Users with that shape should re-pick their
  location via the search.
- Settings → Server → Latitude/Longitude are still present on
  the Settings page but no longer drive any widget. (Phase 4
  could remove them entirely; deferred so this release is
  focused on the user-visible cell editor.)

## [0.64.13], 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`location_search` rolled out across the rest of the
  location-aware widgets:** ``weather_forecast`` (v0.1.5 →
  v0.1.6), ``weather_hourly`` (v0.2.2 → v0.2.3),
  ``weather_now_scenic`` (v0.1.0 → v0.1.1), and
  ``clock_sunrise_sunset`` (v0.1.4 → v0.1.5) now lead with a
  city-search dropdown instead of the lat / lon / label triplet.
  Same Open-Meteo-backed UX as the ``weather_now`` migration in
  v0.64.12; same backwards-compatibility guarantee (existing
  cells with the old shape keep rendering exactly as before).

### Changed

- **"Place label" renamed to "Label"** across all migrated
  widgets. The shorter form reads better in the cell editor's
  field list and matches how the field's described in the help
  copy.
- **JS dispatches both ``input`` and ``change``** when the user
  picks a result from the location search dropdown. The editor's
  autosave listens for both depending on field type; the hidden
  storage element doesn't have a natural blur event so dispatching
  both events covers either listener path. Belt-and-braces against
  the editor's defer-to-blur logic, which gates immediate preview
  updates for some input types.

## [0.64.12], 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`location_search` cell-option type.** A text input + autocomplete
  dropdown backed by Open-Meteo's free geocoding endpoint (same
  provider as Tesserae's weather data, no API key, CC-BY licensed).
  Users type a city name, see a dropdown of disambiguated matches
  (city + region + country), and pick one. The chosen result is
  stored as a dict (``name``, ``country``, ``admin1``, ``latitude``,
  ``longitude``) in the cell's options.
- **`weather_now` (v0.1.8 → v0.1.9) migrated to `location_search`.**
  The primary input is now Location; the legacy ``latitude``,
  ``longitude``, ``label`` fields remain as **optional overrides**
  for power users who want raw coordinates or a custom display name
  (e.g. "Home" instead of "Berlin"). Existing cells with the old
  three-field shape keep working unchanged: when ``location`` is
  empty, the resolver falls back to the legacy fields exactly like
  before.
- **`_resolved_options` promotion path** in ``app/composer.py``:
  when a cell has a populated ``location`` dict, the resolver fills
  in any blank ``latitude`` / ``longitude`` / ``label`` slots from
  the location's ``latitude`` / ``longitude`` / ``name``. An
  explicit per-cell value (set in the optional override fields)
  always beats the location-derived value, so the precedence chain
  is: per-cell override → location-derived → global app setting →
  Melbourne fallback constants.

### Fixed (long-standing UX papercut)

- **The "Melbourne" label that wouldn't go away.** The legacy
  ``label`` cell-option default on the weather widgets used to be
  the literal string ``"Melbourne"``, so a cell that didn't
  explicitly set a label rendered "Melbourne" regardless of the
  actual ``latitude`` / ``longitude``. With the new
  ``location_search`` shape the default is ``""``, and the
  location's ``name`` fills the slot if the user hasn't set an
  explicit override, so picking Berlin from the dropdown actually
  shows "Berlin" on the card. Filed by Bernhard in
  [#26](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/26).

### Why

The legacy ``latitude`` / ``longitude`` / ``label`` triplet had two
related papercuts: (a) users had to know decimal degrees and copy
coords from a separate source, (b) the ``label`` field defaulted to
the wrong string ("Melbourne") regardless of coords. Combining
location-name + coords into a single dropdown-driven option removes
both. Open-Meteo's geocoding is free and licensed compatibly with
Tesserae's existing usage of their weather API, so no new
dependency on Mapbox / Google Places / etc.

### Backwards compatibility

Fully backwards compatible:

- Existing cells with the old three-field shape (``latitude``,
  ``longitude``, ``label``) continue to render exactly as before.
  No data migration runs.
- Old plugin manifests that don't declare a ``location`` option
  load unchanged; the promotion path in ``_resolved_options`` is a
  no-op when ``location`` is absent.
- A widget author migrating their plugin to the new option type
  can declare ``location_search`` alongside the legacy fields; the
  precedence (per-cell override > location-derived) means a
  half-migrated install still resolves sensibly.

### Phase 2 (deferred)

The other widgets that share the same lat/lon/label pattern,
``weather_forecast``, ``weather_hourly``, ``weather_now_scenic``,
``clock_sunrise_sunset``, plus the community catalog's ``sky_*``
widgets, still ship the legacy three-field UI. They'll get the
``location_search`` migration in a follow-up release once Phase 1
has settled.

## [0.64.11], 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **`/mirror/<id>` 500 on a real install.** v0.64.10 read the
  refresh cadence off ``device.settings``, which doesn't exist on
  the real ``Device`` class (only ``device.manifest`` and
  ``device.config_schema`` do; sleep interval lives in the
  settings store under the ``devices`` section). The test stub
  was a wild-card ``MagicMock`` that happily provided the missing
  attribute and the bug shipped. Mirror handler now reads
  ``sleep_interval_s`` via the same priority chain
  ``_next_poll_s`` uses in ``rest_api.py`` (settings-store device
  override → kind's ``config_schema`` default → 60 s fallback).
- **Tighter test stub.** Replaced the wild-card ``MagicMock``
  with a real dataclass that mirrors the surface the handler
  reads from ``Device`` (``id``, ``name``, ``config_schema``).
  A future drift in field names now fails the test loudly
  instead of being silently shimmed. Sleep interval is written
  via ``settings_store.patch_section`` so the read path matches
  production exactly.

## [0.64.10], 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`GET /mirror/<device_id>` browser-friendly mirror page.** A tiny
  auto-refreshing HTML wrapper that embeds the existing
  ``/preview/<id>.png`` so old tablets, jailbroken Kindles in
  browser mode, kiosk PCs, or any screen with a URL bar can run a
  Tesserae dashboard without a native client. Defaults to the
  device's ``sleep_interval_s`` for the refresh cadence; override
  via ``?refresh=N`` (clamped to ``[5, 86400]`` seconds). Optional
  ``?rotate=90/180/270`` applies a CSS rotation client-side so a
  sideways-mounted iPad showing a portrait panel lands the right way
  up. Equivalent in spirit to TRMNL's ``/mirror`` endpoint. Same
  LAN-bypass auth as ``/preview/`` and ``/renders/``.
- **Settings → Devices: Preview + Mirror links** on every device
  card's footer toolbar. The URLs were always reachable but
  undocumented; surfacing them as visible buttons (with descriptive
  tooltips) means an admin can ship a panel-on-a-browser setup in
  one click without reading the spec.

### Why

Real community ask in [#8](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/discussions/8)
(RealGandy): an old iPad running iOS 12 has no TRMNL or Tesserae
native client but can run Safari, so a refresh-tagged page pointing
at the existing per-device preview alias unlocks the device as a
display target with zero firmware work.

## [0.64.9], 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`/status` response carries resolved local-time fields.** The
  heartbeat response (``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/status``) now
  includes ``local_time`` (ISO 8601 with offset), ``tz`` (IANA
  name actually used), ``tz_offset_seconds``, and ``dst_active``
  alongside the existing ``status`` / ``config`` / ``next_poll_s``
  / ``server_time``. The client's heartbeat body can optionally
  include ``tz`` to pick the zone; absent / invalid falls through
  silently to the server's configured ``settings.app.timezone``
  and then to the host's TZ.
- **Spec doc: "Client guarantees" section** in
  ``docs/dev/client-protocol.md`` anchoring the thin-client design
  principle. Future protocol changes get tested against the list
  (no RTC required, no IANA db, no NTP, no schedule math, no
  locale formatting).

### Why

The generic CircuitPython client work (collaborator: bablokb /
Bernhard in [discussion #24](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/discussions/24))
hit the constraint that memory-constrained embedded clients can't
carry the IANA timezone database (~200 KB of flash) or a DST rule
engine. Server-resolved local time is the only sane path. The
existing ``server_time`` is UTC; clients still needed to do the
zone + DST math on every wake. The new fields hand them
everything pre-resolved.

### Backwards compatibility

Fully compatible:

- Existing clients that don't read the new fields silently ignore
  them (per the "clients ignore unknown fields" rule already in
  the spec).
- Existing clients that don't send ``tz`` in the heartbeat get the
  server's TZ fallback, same as if they'd never asked.
- The request shape is unchanged for any caller that ignores the
  new optional field.

## [0.64.8], 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Send page: photo uploads from Android Chrome no longer fail
  with ``ERR_UPLOAD_FILE_CHANGED``**. The dropzone now reads the
  selected file's bytes into memory immediately at selection time
  (via ``File.arrayBuffer()``) and replaces the
  ``<input type="file">`` with a fresh in-memory ``File`` backed by
  those bytes. Form submission therefore no longer depends on the
  OS file handle that Android lets drift — Google Photos sync,
  HEIC→JPEG conversion, EXIF rewriting, and similar background
  modifications between selection and submit are now invisible to
  Chrome's upload comparison. The form submit handler awaits any
  in-flight snapshot so a quick tap on **Push file** while
  ``arrayBuffer()`` is still resolving doesn't sneak the original
  URI through. Sub-second for the 16 MiB max even on mid-range
  phones, so the delay is invisible in the common case.

### Why

Multiple Android users reported the file picker showing the
selected photo and "2.82 MB" file size, then Chrome aborting the
submit with ``ERR_UPLOAD_FILE_CHANGED`` and dropping them on
Chrome's "Your file couldn't be accessed" error page. The bytes
never reached Flask — Chrome compares the file size + mtime it
cached at selection time with what it sees at submit time and
refuses to send mismatched data. The fix attacks the underlying
race: snapshot the bytes once, hold them in JS memory, and submit
those instead of asking Chrome to re-read.

## [0.64.7], 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Dashboard editor: live preview now actually sticks**. The
  preview card has ``position: sticky`` so it stays visible as the
  user scrolls through the cell editors below it, but
  ``html, body { overflow-x: hidden }`` in ``base.css`` was
  silently establishing a new scroll container and breaking
  sticky positioning across the whole document. Swapped the
  declaration for ``overflow-x: clip`` (same visual no-scrollbar
  guarantee, no scroll-container side-effect), with ``hidden`` as
  a cascade fallback for browsers without ``clip``.
- **Dashboard editor: preview no longer hides behind the title
  header**. The preview-card was sticky-pinned at ``top: 84px``
  while the editor-header (sticky at ``64px``, ~68px tall) sits
  in the same band — so the preview tucked behind the header on
  scroll. Bumped the preview's sticky top to ``140px`` so it sits
  cleanly below the header with an 8px gap.
- **Dashboard editor: preview frame capped to viewport height**.
  Portrait panels (e.g. 800×1200) made the preview card taller
  than the viewport, so sticky pinned only the top portion. Added
  a ``max-width`` driven by available vertical space
  (``min(720px, (100vh - 252px) × --panel-ar)``) mirroring the
  trick already used on mobile, so the whole card fits regardless
  of panel orientation.
- **Sparkline charts: spline overshoot no longer clipped**.
  Chart.js with ``tension: 0.3`` produces a curve that overshoots
  the data max on a sharp spike; the sparkline's y-axis was sized
  exactly to ``max(values)`` so the overshoot got sliced off flat
  against the top edge. Added ``grace: "12%"`` so the spline has
  headroom to breathe.

## [0.64.6], 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Telemetry: accurate IP-suppression mechanism**. The
  ``_privacy_props`` helper used to ship ``$ip: ""`` on every
  PostHog event, claiming this prevented IP storage. It didn't —
  ``$ip`` is a PostHog *override* for the IP used during geo
  enrichment, not a suppression of storage. The real mechanism is
  the project-level **Discard client IP data** toggle in PostHog
  Project Settings, which has now been enabled on the maintainer's
  project. The ``$ip`` property has been dropped from the payload
  (it was a no-op), and the module docstring + privacy doc + test
  assertions now describe the actual mechanism.

### Why

A live look at incoming events showed the full client IP
(``180.181.192.166``) being stored alongside city / postal code /
lat-lon. The ``$ip: ""`` we'd been shipping since v0.64.0 wasn't
doing anything; PostHog was reading the request IP from the
reverse-proxy ``X-Forwarded-For`` header and storing it
regardless. The privacy doc + onboarding consent footnote
promised "no IP storage" — that promise is now actually upheld by
the project-level toggle. Behaviour for users who already
consented to telemetry is otherwise unchanged.

## [0.64.5], 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Onboarding wizard: new "Timezone" step**. Slots in right
  after Welcome, before Transport. The picker is pre-selected
  with the host-detected IANA name (``TZ`` env var or
  ``/etc/localtime`` symlink target), so a sensible default lands
  one click away. The user can keep it or pick another. Skip
  button writes ``system`` (scheduler-time auto-detect, defaults
  to UTC on bare Docker).

### Why

The scheduler interprets every daily fire time and time-of-day
window against ``settings.app.timezone``. On Docker images
without ``TZ=`` set, that resolves to UTC — so a brand-new user
creates an *8:00 AM* schedule expecting breakfast, gets pushed
to dinner-time. Surfacing the picker during onboarding instead
of burying it under Settings → App means new installs land
already pointing at the right zone.

### Side benefit

v0.64.4's ``timezone`` / ``timezone_region`` telemetry props
now populate for every event from the first heartbeat onward
(instead of for installs where the system path happens to find
a real IANA name). The wizard's save handler also live-updates
the in-process ``Telemetry._cfg`` so the very next heartbeat
already carries the new timezone — no restart required.

### Tests

Three new tests in ``test_onboarding.py``: the timezone step
renders with a populated picker, picking a valid IANA name
saves it + redirects to broker, and a bogus hand-typed value
falls through to ``"system"`` instead of slipping into
settings.

## [0.64.4], 2026-06-22

### Added

- **Timezone properties on every telemetry event**. Every event
  now carries ``timezone`` (the resolved IANA name, e.g.
  ``Australia/Melbourne``) and ``timezone_region`` (the first
  segment, ``Australia``) when one can be derived. The resolution
  order is: ``settings.app.timezone`` (validated against
  ``zoneinfo.available_timezones()``) → ``TZ`` env var → parse
  ``/etc/localtime`` symlink target. When nothing resolves, the
  properties are *omitted* from the event rather than shipped as
  ``UTC`` (which would collapse every default-Docker install into
  one bucket and lose the signal). Gives the maintainer
  user-set geographic data without IP geolocation — works on
  Docker, doesn't depend on the reverse-proxy's
  ``X-Forwarded-For`` plumbing.

### Notes

- The v0.64.5 followup will add a timezone-picker step to the
  onboarding wizard so new installs land with a real IANA name
  set instead of relying on the system auto-detect path.

## [0.64.3], 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Rotation edit jumped to the wrong card and lost context on
  save**. Clicking *Edit* on a rotation routed the browser to
  ``#rotation-form-card`` — the *New rotation* card at the bottom
  of the page — instead of the rotation being edited. And after a
  successful save the redirect dropped both the ``?edit=`` query
  param and any URL fragment, leaving the user at the top of the
  rotations list with no idea where they were. Fixed both:
  - The *Edit* link now anchors to ``#rotation-<id>`` so the
    browser scrolls the in-flight edit form into view.
  - ``rotations.update``'s success + validation-error redirects
    both append ``#rotation-<id>`` so the page lands back at the
    just-edited card.
- **In-flight rotation card now wears an accent halo**. The
  rotation being edited picks up a new ``.is-editing`` class on
  the rotation card (``.dx-rotation-status`` already pins the
  status pill to the top-right). The card border flips to the
  accent colour with a soft accent-tint outer shadow so the user
  can see at a glance which card holds the edit form — useful
  when they scroll up to compare the read view of the rotation
  to the form below.

## [0.64.2], 2026-06-22

### Changed

- **PostHog endpoint moved behind the maintainer's reverse proxy
  at ``https://t.dmello.io``** (forwards to PostHog Cloud US).
  Both the in-app telemetry POST URL and the docs-site JS
  snippet's ``api_host`` are updated; the proxy forwards both
  ``/i/v0/e/`` (events) and ``/static/array.js`` (the lazy-loaded
  SDK bundle). The events PostHog actually receives are byte-
  identical to before.
- **Why**: bypasses network-level ad-blockers (uBlock's default
  lists, Pi-hole, NextDNS) that silently drop requests to known
  analytics origins — a non-trivial fraction of the privacy-
  conscious Tesserae audience runs one of these. Going via a
  first-party-looking domain means opt-in installs that would
  previously have failed at the DNS layer now actually deliver
  events.
- **JS SDK**: docs snippet picks up ``ui_host:
  'https://us.posthog.com'`` so PostHog's occasional "view in
  PostHog" deep-links resolve to the real dashboard instead of
  trying to point back at the proxy.
- **Privacy doc** updated: the "block this to opt out at the
  network level" instruction now names ``t.dmello.io``.

### Notes

- Self-host instructions for the reverse proxy aren't in-repo;
  it's just an nginx/Caddy block that maps ``t.dmello.io/i/* ->
  us.i.posthog.com/i/*`` and ``t.dmello.io/static/* ->
  us-assets.i.posthog.com/static/*``.

## [0.64.1], 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- **Telemetry copy mentioned only two of the four events**. The
  Settings → Server → App toggle help text and the System tab's
  Telemetry card subtitle still listed only ``app.started`` +
  ``update.applied``. ``app.heartbeat`` (added v0.5x) and
  ``theme.user_created`` (v0.6x) were silently shipping but the
  user-facing copy never caught up. v0.64.0's PostHog swap was
  a good moment to fix it; also threaded in the country/region
  detail that's new with PostHog.
- **CI fix for v0.64.0 rename**: ``tests/test_system_routes.py``
  was still constructing ``TelemetryConfig`` with the old
  ``app_key`` kwarg instead of ``project_key``. Already pushed
  as ``4e8762b``; included here for changelog completeness.

## [0.64.0], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Telemetry backend swapped from self-hosted Aptabase to
  PostHog Cloud (US region)**. Same three events
  (``app.started``, ``app.heartbeat``, ``update.applied``) plus
  ``theme.user_created``, same anonymous install UUID, same
  no-PII data footprint, same opt-in default-off behaviour, same
  ``TESSERAE_TELEMETRY=0`` kill switch. The wire format changed:
  POSTs now go to ``https://us.i.posthog.com/i/v0/e/`` with a
  flat ``{api_key, event, distinct_id, properties, timestamp}``
  body instead of the Aptabase-shaped ``{sessionId, eventName,
  systemProps, props}``.
- **Privacy hardening on every event**. Every POST carries
  ``$ip: ""`` (request IP not stored on the event) and
  ``$process_person_profile: false`` (no PostHog "person"
  profile created or updated for the install UUID). PostHog
  still uses the request IP at ingestion to derive country +
  region columns — the maintainer wants those to see roughly
  where Tesserae is running — then drops the IP. Pinned via
  ``test_privacy_props_present_on_every_event`` so a future
  refactor can't drift.
- **Docs site analytics**: ``overrides/main.html`` swapped from
  the Umami snippet (``analytics.dmello.io``) to the PostHog JS
  snippet, configured for ``autocapture: false``,
  ``disable_session_recording: true``, ``respect_dnt: true``,
  ``person_profiles: 'identified_only'``. Same project as the
  in-app telemetry so docs traffic + in-app events can be
  cross-queried.
- **Why**: Aptabase's dashboards weren't giving the maintainer
  the cohort + funnel views needed to actually answer questions
  about how Tesserae is used. PostHog's free tier covers the
  expected fleet shape comfortably.
- **Env var rename**: ``TESSERAE_TELEMETRY_APP_KEY`` →
  ``TESSERAE_TELEMETRY_PROJECT_KEY``. ``TESSERAE_TELEMETRY_HOST``
  unchanged. The ``TESSERAE_TELEMETRY=0`` hard kill is unchanged.

### Notes

- Onboarding telemetry-consent copy + ``docs/privacy.md`` +
  ``README.md`` rewritten to describe the new backend +
  surveillance-feature kill-switches.
- The legacy ``aptabase.dmello.io`` endpoint can be sunset after
  enough installs have updated to v0.64.0+.

## [0.63.13], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **CORS ``Allow-Headers`` now includes ``X-Pairing-Code``**. The
  ``/api/v1/device/register`` endpoint reads the 6-digit pair
  code from that header (see ``post_register`` in
  ``app/rest_api.py``). v0.63.11 listed every other custom
  header the API uses but missed this one, so the browser-based
  emulator's first call — the pairing fetch — failed at
  preflight with "Request header field x-pairing-code is not
  allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers." Added a test that
  preflights ``/register`` with the header and asserts it's in
  the allow list.

## [0.63.12], 2026-06-21

### Added

- **CORS on ``/renders/<digest>.<ext>`` and ``/preview/<id>.png``**.
  v0.63.11 added CORS to the REST API but the image endpoints
  the API returns URLs for stayed same-origin only. A browser
  drawing those images into a ``<canvas>`` cross-origin tainted
  the canvas — the image displayed fine but ``getImageData()``
  was blocked, so the device emulator's per-pixel palette-
  quantization preview (Spectra 6 / mono / 4-grey simulation)
  couldn't run. Added ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` to both
  routes. No new data exposed: the image was already fetchable
  from any origin via ``<img src>`` — the header just unlocks
  pixel access. The auth bypass for these routes (loopback /
  LAN-only via ``app/auth.py`` ``_LAN_PATHS``) is unchanged.

## [0.63.11], 2026-06-21

### Added

- **CORS on the ``/api/v1/device/*`` REST API**. Every response
  now carries ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` plus
  ``Allow-Methods`` / ``Allow-Headers`` / ``Expose-Headers``;
  ``OPTIONS`` requests short-circuit to a 204 with the same
  headers. Unblocks browser-based callers: the in-browser
  device emulator at ``emulator.tesserae.ink`` (planned), the
  "Test push" UI in the future HTTP-push transport (#23), and
  any other browser tool that needs to pair + poll a Tesserae
  server. ``Allow-Origin: *`` is safe here because every endpoint
  already requires a Bearer token — the token is the security
  boundary, not the origin. Admin UI / settings / plugin routes
  outside this blueprint are unaffected.

## [0.63.10], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **``.sr-only`` was used but never defined**, so the rotation
  step rows' "Play step N now" hidden labels rendered as visible
  text — and once v0.62.x clamped icon-only buttons to a 34×34
  square, the visible text overflowed the box and showed up as a
  ghost rectangle next to the icon. Added the canonical
  visually-hidden utility class to base.css.
- **History rows redesigned for mobile**. The v0.63.9 attempt
  flex-wrapped each section to its own line and ballooned each
  row to ~250 px tall on a phone. Replaced with a compact 2-col
  grid (thumbnail in the left column spanning all rows; the
  right column stacks time / source / status on three short
  lines). Reads as a tight card-style row instead of a 4-line
  pile-up.

## [0.63.9], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Mobile overflow pass** (Rotations + History + Widgets +
  Settings + Schedule editor + Rotation editor). Four screenshots
  in a row surfaced the same root: pages built at desktop widths
  had no responsive collapse at narrow viewports, so form heads
  with trailing meta + input chrome overflowed their cards,
  row-style content (history rows, widget rows) starved their
  middle column of width, and the field-grid clung to multi-
  column layouts past the point of usability.
  - New ``static/style/dx-responsive.css`` (~110 lines) holds
    the entire mobile pass. Loaded last in ``_base.html`` so its
    ``@media`` rules win against any per-page sheet's
    breakpoints.
  - ``html, body { overflow-x: hidden; max-width: 100% }`` in
    base.css as a safety net so a stray wide descendant can't
    force horizontal page scroll.
  - Section card padding compresses 22/24 → 16/14 at ≤640 px,
    then 14/12 at ≤480 px.
  - ``.dx-section-head`` flex-wraps so trailing meta / cta /
    URL inputs drop below the title.
  - History + Widgets row layouts collapse to stacked at
    ≤640 px (same pattern Dashboards picked up in v0.63.8).
  - Tabs row scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping to two
    lines on small screens.
  - Dashboard create-row stacks at ≤480 px (Create-dashboard
    button goes full-width below the input).
- **Rotation status pill pinned to the top-right corner of its
  card**. The "Not active right now" / "Now: step N…" pill was
  flowing inside the section head row, vertically centred next
  to the title. Switched to ``position: absolute; top: 18px;
  right: 22px`` on the card so the pill always hugs the card's
  top-right corner regardless of how tall the title block grows.
  At ≤640 px the pin releases and the pill flows back below the
  title (would otherwise overlap a narrow title block).

## [0.63.8], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Dashboards page now responsive at phone widths**. The row
  layout (icon + name + meta strip on the left, three action
  buttons on the right) was fine at desktop but starved the left
  half of horizontal space on a 390-px viewport — the dashboard
  name wrapped one word per line and the buttons visually
  overlapped the meta strip. Added a ``@media (max-width: 640px)``
  collapse that flips ``.dx-dashboard-row`` to a column layout
  with the actions dropping below the row content. Same pattern
  ``.dx-discovered-row`` on Devices already uses. Also added a
  single-line truncation on ``.dx-dashboard-name`` so a long
  title doesn't push the meta strip out of the row.

## [0.63.7], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **settings.css → dx-history.css + dx-events.css** (the last
  two page-specific extractions). History (~130 lines, row
  layout + timestamp + thumbnail + source-pill palette + device
  chip) and Events (~200 lines, per-type swatch on rows + on
  filter chips, summary/body/expand grid, lazy-hydrate JSON
  placeholder) move to their own stylesheets. settings.css drops
  another ~330 lines.
- **settings.css** now ends at ~3000 lines (down from 3370),
  with the page-specific blocks (Battery / Dashboards /
  Marketplace / History / Events) extracted. What remains is
  true Settings-page styling, dx-* shared primitives, the
  card_head adapter, and the dark-mode block — i.e. the file
  is roughly what it should have been all along.

## [0.63.6], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **settings.css → dx-dashboards.css + dx-marketplace.css**.
  Dashboards (~35 lines, ``.dx-dashboard-create`` / ``-group``
  / ``-group-head``) and Widgets Browse (~85 lines, ``.dx-mkt-
  search`` / ``.dx-mkt-chips`` / ``.dx-mkt-chip``) each move
  to their own stylesheet. Batched as one release because the
  two blocks together are small. Cascade order preserved. No
  rules changed.

## [0.63.5], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **settings.css → dx-battery.css**: Battery dashboard rules
  (97 lines, ``dx-battery-grid`` / ``-card`` / ``-head`` / etc.)
  moved to their own stylesheet. Cascade order preserved by
  linking the new file in the same slot the rules previously
  occupied (right after dx-schedules.css). No rules changed.
  settings.css banner kept so the file map still reflects the
  extraction.

## [0.63.4], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Login + Setup**: outer card adds the ``.dx-section-card``
  class (keeping ``.narrow`` for max-width) so the auth-flow
  pages inherit the v0.56 chrome (box-shadow, border-radius,
  border) instead of the legacy card look. Surgical — the
  ``card_head`` adapter handles the inner header chrome and
  the form layout is otherwise unchanged. ``onboarding.html``'s
  one remaining ``card--wizard-info`` block is intentionally
  left on the legacy chrome; it's an info-callout role inside
  a wizard step body, not a section card, so it doesn't map
  onto the ``section_card`` vocabulary.

## [0.63.3], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Page editor: outer card chrome flips to ``.dx-section-card``**.
  Five live ``<section class="card">`` blocks (per-cell card +
  Live preview + Dashboard + Layout + Schedules) become
  ``.dx-section-card`` so the editor reads as siblings of the
  rest of v0.56-uplifted pages. The custom drag-tile-to-canvas
  interaction model + the bespoke cell-card header styling are
  preserved; only the outer shell flipped. ``card_head`` adapter
  carries the header chrome inside each card.

## [0.63.2], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Settings page: remaining live ``<section class="card">``
  blocks flip to ``.dx-section-card``**. Three small cards (top-
  level Diagnostics + Server-tab Diagnostics + Sign-out) were
  still on the legacy card class while everything else around
  them had already moved. The pragmatic ``card_head`` adapter in
  settings.css handles the header chrome; this is just the outer
  shell. Most of the file's remaining ``class="card"`` matches
  live inside ``{% if False %}`` dead-branch guards left over
  from the device-card v2 migration.

## [0.63.1], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Themes builder uplifted to ``section_card`` chrome**. The
  three builder sections (Seed from image / Identity / Colour
  palette) flip from the legacy ``<section class="card">`` +
  ``<header class="card-head">`` markup to proper
  ``.dx-section-card`` + ``.dx-section-head`` (teal icon square +
  title + description). Builder head action buttons flip to
  ``.dx-btn-ghost-sm`` / ``.dx-btn-primary``; the delete button
  goes icon-only. The v0.59.0 release note that called Themes
  "Tier 4 done" had only flipped the Update button; this is the
  actual structural pass.

## [0.63.0], 2026-06-21

Hygiene pass. Cleans up two pre-v0.56 selectors that survived the
admin UI uplift and were quietly diverging from the rest of the
admin surface.

### Fixed

- **events.js targets the v0.56 markup**. Pre-v0.63 the live-SSE
  script looked for ``.events`` / ``.event-row`` (the legacy
  classes the template stopped emitting at v0.56). It silently
  spawned a phantom unstyled ``<ul class="events">`` at the
  bottom of the page on every load to receive SSE rows that the
  user couldn't see. Rewrote to target ``.dx-events-list`` and
  emit the full ``.dx-event-row`` / ``.dx-event-summary`` /
  ``.dx-event-body`` / ``.dx-pill`` markup so streamed events
  look identical to the server-rendered rows (including the
  per-type icon swatch via ``.dx-event-row--<type>``). The
  live indicator label now matches the static "LIVE" /
  "Connecting…" / "Offline" treatment.
- **Condition picker JSON highlight consolidated**. The picker
  emitted bespoke ``cp-jh-key`` / ``cp-jh-str`` / ``cp-jh-num``
  / ``cp-jh-kw`` classes whose palette lived in schedules.css,
  parallel to the events page's shared ``dx-code-*`` palette in
  settings.css. The picker now emits ``dx-code-*`` directly so
  the condition editor + events JSON share a single source of
  truth; the duplicated rules in schedules.css are removed.

## [0.62.5], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Saved schedules table: action buttons stop stacking**. The
  Disable / Fire now / Edit / Delete buttons were each wrapping
  to their own line because the cell uses ``width: 1%`` (shrinks
  to content) and the labelled buttons overflowed at any
  reasonable column width. Flipped all four to ``.dx-btn-icon-
  only`` (with title + aria-label so the verb is still
  discoverable), pinned ``flex-wrap: nowrap`` on the action row,
  and made the inline forms ``display: inline-flex`` so they
  don't break the row themselves.
- **Edit schedule form picks up the same input + alignment
  polish as Rotations**. The v0.62.2/0.62.4 selectors were
  scoped to ``.rotation-form``; mirror them under ``.schedule-
  form`` so the Name / Dashboard / Interval / Active window /
  Priority fields land on the v0.56 ``.dx-input`` baseline, the
  Smart sync row vertically centres next to Render lead, and
  the ``info_pop`` button sits inline with the toggle.

## [0.62.4], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Day-of-week chips now centre properly**. The v0.62.2/0.62.3
  attempts didn't account for the hidden checkbox AND anonymous
  whitespace text nodes both still acting as flex items between
  the input and the visible span. Took the input out of flow
  entirely (``position: absolute; opacity: 0``) so it covers the
  chip for click handling without consuming any layout, then
  flipped the chip itself to ``display: grid; place-items: center``
  so positioning is unambiguous.
- **Smart sync row vertical alignment**. The switch component is
  a single-line label; the neighbouring Render lead field has a
  label-above-input stack. Without ``align-items: center`` on the
  parent grid, the toggle floated next to the input's label
  instead of the input itself. Added the alignment override to
  ``.rotation-form .field-grid``, plus a flex layout on
  ``.field--switch`` so the trailing ``info_pop`` button sits
  inline with the toggle instead of wrapping to its own line.

### Added

- **Conditions toggle: live count update**. The
  ``Conditions (N)`` label now reflects condition adds/removes in
  the picker, not just the server-rendered initial count. The
  condition picker already fires a synthetic ``change`` event on
  its hidden textarea whenever ``writeRows`` runs; the rotation
  form's container delegates on that event, parses the JSON, and
  updates the matching step's toggle label in place.

### Changed

- **Condition picker rows: responsive layout**. The kind select
  was stretching to full row width at narrow viewports because
  it was the only flex child on its line. Constrained it to
  content width (max 180 px), pinned the remove button to the
  right edge via ``margin-left: auto``, and rebalanced the
  ``.cp-row-body`` flex weights so entity/operator/value wrap
  consistently.

## [0.62.3], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Condition picker inputs now match the v0.56 input baseline**.
  The previous pass only styled inputs inside ``.field`` wrappers,
  which the condition picker doesn't use — its selects + text
  inputs land directly in ``.cp-row-body`` / ``.cp-row``. Added
  selectors for ``.condition-picker .cp-row-body input/select``
  + ``.condition-picker .cp-row > select`` so the HA entity
  dropdown, source-id input, operator select, and value input
  all read as siblings of the rotation form's anchor fields.
- **Day-of-week chips: centring rule promoted to base
  ``.dow-chip``** rather than scoped to ``.rotation-form``, so
  the rule fires anywhere the chip is used (rotation form,
  schedule form, condition picker time-window builder).

## [0.62.2], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Rotation form inputs match Tesserae's v0.56 input baseline**.
  The Name / Cycle starts / Cycle ends / Priority fields (plus
  the page select + dwell number on each step) inherited the
  legacy ``.field`` shape (6 px radius, 8/12 px padding, lighter
  border). They now use the ``.dx-input`` baseline (8 px radius,
  11/13 px padding, slightly heavier ``--t-input-border``) so the
  form visually belongs to the same admin surface as the rest of
  v0.56-uplifted pages.
- **Day-of-week chips: text now sits dead-centre**. The hidden
  checkbox inside each ``.dow-chip`` was a flex child sharing a
  gap with the visible label, which shifted the label visually
  right. Set ``justify-content: center; gap: 0`` on the chip and
  gave it a minimum width so the labels read as a balanced
  segmented control.

## [0.62.1], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Rotations form: each step becomes a self-contained sub-card**.
  The ``.rot-step-wrap`` wrapper picks up real chrome (inset
  background + 1px border + 12px radius + padding) so the controls
  row and the Conditions panel underneath read as one tile per
  step instead of two free-floating blocks. When the user opens
  Conditions, the panel "swells" inside the same sub-card,
  separated only by a top divider — no floating panel, no visual
  disconnect from its step.
- **Rotations form: Conditions toggle gains a filled active state**.
  ``aria-expanded="true"`` swaps the ghost outline for an
  accent-tint fill so the toggle visually pins to its expanded
  panel, matching the spec's "active when open" pattern.
- **Rotations form: structure pass**.
  - New "STEPS — ROTATE THROUGH THESE IN ORDER" uppercase
    sub-heading above the steps list (``dx-form-subhead``).
  - ``<hr class="dx-divider">`` between the anchor / steps /
    days / sync / routing / enabled groups so the form reads
    as distinct logical sections.
  - "+ Add step" affordance becomes a full-width dashed button
    (``.dx-rot-add-step``) — reads as "drop another step here"
    instead of "click this small thing in the corner."
  - Form submit button flips to ``.dx-btn-primary``; Cancel
    flips to ``.dx-btn-ghost-sm``.

The condition picker itself is unchanged (works at v0.55 fidelity,
JSON highlighter just got fixed in v0.60.1); the sub-card is the
visual containment.

## [0.62.0], 2026-06-21

The parked Rotations + Schedules uplift from v0.60.1's notes, plus
a navigation pass on the settings.css "junk drawer."

### Changed

- **Rotations** (``/rotations``): each rotation card now uses the
  proper ``section_card`` macro — teal icon square, rotation
  name, id as the description code, status pills on the right —
  instead of the legacy ``.rotation-head`` markup. Steps preview
  list converts to ``.dx-inset-row`` rows with a step-number
  tile, page name + dwell, bound-device chips, and an inline
  play button for the active step. Action buttons (Disable /
  Fire now / Edit / Delete) move to the ``.dx-btn-ghost-sm``
  vocabulary and the trash button goes icon-only. The "New
  rotation" form gets the same ``section_card`` chrome via the
  macro instead of going through the legacy ``card_head``
  adapter.
- **Schedules** (``/schedules``): saved-schedule table actions
  flip to ``.dx-btn-ghost-sm``; state pills move from ``.pill``
  to ``.dx-pill`` with a tone dot; trash button goes icon-only.
  The "page deleted" warning pill picks up the danger-pill
  chrome from the v0.56 token set.
- **New stylesheets**: ``static/style/dx-rotations.css`` (~150
  lines) holds the new Rotations chrome; ``dx-schedules.css``
  (~40 lines) holds the action-row layout. Loaded after
  ``schedules.css`` so the cascade order matches existing
  expectations.
- **settings.css navigation**: 3300-line file gains a top-of-
  file Table of Contents banner + per-page section banners
  marking the parts that are candidates for extraction (Battery,
  History, Events, Dashboards, Marketplace). No rules moved,
  no behaviour change — preparation for the eventual split.

## [0.61.2], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **REST ``/api/v1/device/<id>/frame`` was missing renderer-specific
  payload fields**. A pi_png client polling the endpoint logged
  ``download/paint failed: payload missing 'rotate'`` because the
  response only carried the REST envelope (``url``, ``format``,
  ``panel_w/h``, ``render_id``, ``renderer_id``) and not the
  v3-frozen ``{rotate, scale, bg, saturation}`` fields its MQTT-
  subscribed cousins receive. ``get_frame`` now resolves the
  renderer for the latest frame, pulls its runtime settings, and
  merges ``renderer.payload()`` into the response. Pi BIN /
  ESP32 / TRMNL / pico_bin REST clients pick up their renderer-
  specific fields the same way; nothing kind-specific in the new
  code path.

## [0.61.1], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Default sleep / refresh cadence dropped from 15 min to 60 s
  across every device kind** (esp32, esp32_bw, pico_bin, pi_bin,
  pi_png, trmnl). Newly paired devices stay responsive enough for
  the user to log in and pick a reasonable cadence before the
  device disappears into long sleep. Existing devices keep their
  saved value untouched.

## [0.61.0], 2026-06-21

### Added

- **pi_bin_client / pi_png_client: sleep interval setting**
  ([devices/pi_bin_client/device.json](devices/pi_bin_client/device.json),
  [devices/pi_png_client/device.json](devices/pi_png_client/device.json)).
  Both Pi clients now declare a ``sleep_interval_s`` field in their
  ``config_schema`` (default 15 min, bounds 30 s – 7 days) with the
  same preset list the ESP32 client carries. REST-polled instances
  pick the new cadence up via the existing ``_next_poll_s`` /
  ``_current_config`` helpers in [app/rest_api.py](app/rest_api.py),
  which already echo per-device config back to the client in the
  ``/api/v1/device/<id>/status`` response. MQTT-driven instances
  ignore the field (they wake on retained-frame publishes).
  ``validate_config`` enforces the bounds server-side before a
  typoed cadence reaches the client. Manifest version bumped on
  both kinds (0.1.0 → 0.2.0).

## [0.60.5], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Events page server freeze after clicking through filter
  chips**: each chip click opens a new SSE connection to
  ``/events/stream``; the previous connection's generator was
  blocked in ``queue.get(timeout=15s)`` and only learned the
  client had disconnected on the next yield (i.e. after a
  keepalive fired up to 15 seconds later). With waitress's 8-
  worker thread pool, eight rapid clicks pinned every thread on
  stale SSE generators and the server stopped answering new
  requests until cleanup eventually ran. Shortened the keepalive
  interval to 2 seconds so dead clients are detected within ~2
  seconds and worker threads return to the pool. v0.60.3's lazy
  payload hydration already fixed the browser-side cumulative
  cost; this fixes the server-side wedge.

## [0.60.4], 2026-06-21

Two Send fixes from the next walkthrough.

### Fixed

- **Send (Live preview)**: the right card was sitting ~16px
  below the left because the global
  ``.dx-section-card + .dx-section-card { margin-top: 16px }``
  sibling rule (added in v0.60.0 for stacked admin cards) was
  also firing inside the 2-column grid. Cancelled the margin
  scoped to ``.send-pair > .dx-section-card`` so both card
  tops align again.
- **Send (Live preview)**: the preview-frame was capped at 480px
  (from the v0.60.2 patch) which left obvious empty space on a
  page-wide layout. Lifted the cap entirely and bumped the
  column ratio to the spec's ``1fr 1.18fr`` so the preview
  grows to fill the available column width.

## [0.60.3], 2026-06-21

Events page performance + readability, Send alignment.

### Fixed

- **Events page lag after clicking through filter chips**:
  expanded payloads now lazily hydrate on first click. The JSON
  payload is stashed in a ``<script type="application/json"
  data-event-json>`` block per row; the in-house highlighter only
  walks + tokenises a row's JSON when the user actually opens it.
  Initial DOM is ~50× lighter for a 100-row telemetry view and
  the cumulative slowdown from clicking through chip filters is
  gone.
- **Events filter-chip active state readability**: the active
  chip used the per-type pastel pair (fg-on-bg) which was hard
  to read at small sizes. Flipped to a high-contrast pattern —
  the chip's saturated fg becomes the background and the text
  flips to white. Count pill stays visible via a translucent
  white tint.
- **Events Device chip**: gained its own colour swatch (rose)
  rather than the muted neutral that read as "no colour".
- **Send (Live preview) alignment**: the right card's section
  header sat lower than the left because ``.send-pair-preview``
  was a 2-row grid with a 12px gap between header and body.
  Reverted to plain block flow so the section_head sits at the
  same Y as the options card's header.

## [0.60.2], 2026-06-21

Three regressions from the v0.60.1 polish: search refresh, broken
Send preview, missing event-type colours.

### Fixed

- **Widgets Browse search**: typing no longer refreshes the page.
  Switched from a debounced auto-submit + sessionStorage focus
  restore to a client-side DOM filter — each card carries a
  ``data-search-haystack`` of its id + name + description +
  author + tags, and the JS filter toggles ``hidden`` on a plain
  ``indexOf`` match. Focus + caret stay put naturally. Submitting
  the form (Enter) still does a full GET so ``?q=`` URLs stay
  shareable, and ``_filter_entries`` server-side honours the
  query for that case + no-JS users.
- **Send (Live preview)**: the v0.60.1 flex + ``width: auto``
  override collapsed the preview-frame to zero width when its
  ``.dx-section-body`` flex container was ``align-items: center``.
  Reverted the flex shim and replaced it with a simple
  ``max-width: 480px`` on the preview-frame so a portrait panel
  ratio (1200×1600 → 3:4) caps at ~640px tall while keeping the
  frame's actual width visible.

### Changed

- **Events**: ``renderer`` + ``rotation`` event types now have
  their own icon swatches (blue and teal). The previous pass
  only added ``render`` and missed the real type strings emitted
  by the push pipeline + scheduler. Per-type swatches are now
  expressed as CSS custom properties (``--evt-fg/bg/bd``) so the
  row icon and the filter chip pick up the same colour from one
  source of truth.
- **Events filter chips**: each chip mirrors the swatch of the
  event type it filters by. Active state fills with the per-type
  background instead of the generic accent tint.

## [0.60.1], 2026-06-21

Second round of post-uplift polish from a live walkthrough.

### Changed

- **Inset background**: lightened the warm-taupe inset surface from
  ``#f6f5f1`` / ``#f3f2ee`` to ``#faf9f6`` so inset rows on
  Dashboards, History, Events, Plugins index, and the per-tab
  sub-cards on Settings sit closer to the section card surface
  with less visual weight.
- **Events**: per-type icon backgrounds gain distinct hues —
  render = blue, conditions = violet, heartbeat = danger,
  auth = mint, plugin = amber, transport/telemetry = teal,
  device = neutral — so the event type is recognisable at a
  glance without reading the pill.
- **Send (Live preview)**: the preview card now stretches to
  match the options card height (``align-items: stretch``) and
  the preview frame is clamped to ``min(70vh, 640px)`` so a
  portrait panel aspect ratio (1200×1600) no longer dwarfs the
  left options column. The pair reads as a balanced 2-up.
- **Widgets Browse**: search input preserves focus + caret
  position across the debounced auto-submit roundtrip via a
  sessionStorage marker — typing no longer loses focus mid-query.
- **Widgets Browse**: kind + tag chips moved off the legacy
  ``.pill`` vocabulary to a dedicated ``.dx-mkt-chip`` set
  matching the spec — outlined pill with a tiny count badge,
  filled accent tint on active.

### Fixed

- **Condition picker raw JSON**: the syntax highlighter was
  matching the HTML entity ``&quot;`` against escaped output,
  but quote characters weren't included in the escape map so the
  regex never hit a token — the overlay rendered as plain text.
  Switched to matching real quotes against the partially-escaped
  string, so keys / strings / numbers / keywords now colour in
  the rotation + schedule condition editors.

### Notes

- The Rotations + Schedules page-level card chrome is still on
  the legacy ``.rotation-card`` / ``.timeline-card`` shapes from
  before the uplift. A heavier rewrite to put them on the same
  ``section_card`` macro as the rest of v0.56 is parked as a
  follow-up; this release covers the spec-derived polish that
  the existing surface needed first.

## [0.60.0], 2026-06-21

Post-uplift polish from a live walkthrough of the v0.59.0 admin UI.
Six fixes across five pages plus a missing search input on Browse.

### Changed

- **Dashboards** (``/pages``): the inline "New dashboard" form and
  the saved list fuse into a single section card so there is no
  sibling gap between them. Saved dashboards now group under their
  bound device, alphabetical within each group, with an "Unbound"
  group at the end. Pages without an ``icon`` set fall back to
  ``ph-cube`` instead of ``ph-squares-four``.
- **Schedules** / Rotations / Settings tabs: a global
  ``.dx-section-card + .dx-section-card { margin-top: 16px; }``
  rule gives every page with stacked section cards consistent
  vertical rhythm without per-page CSS.
- **History** (``/history``): each push row gains a 64×64 square
  thumbnail on the left. Click opens the same lightbox as the
  timestamp link. Pushes with no stored render show a placeholder
  square so the layout stays aligned.
- **Battery dashboard** (``/devices/battery``): the 4-tile stat
  grid forces ``repeat(4, 1fr)`` so Samples / Drain rate / Reaches
  20% / Reaches 0% sit in one row at desktop widths; collapses to
  2×2 below 720px.
- **Events** (``/events``): expanded payload uses a two-column
  grid — raw JSON (or conditions block) fills the left column,
  the optional 120px render thumb sits on the right — so the
  expand region uses the full row width instead of stacking
  narrowly under the icon. Single-column fallback on narrow
  viewports.
- **Rotations** (``/rotations``): the per-step Conditions panel
  stays collapsed by default even when the saved step has
  conditions, matching the user's expectation that the form is
  empty until they click in.

### Added

- **Widgets Browse** (``/plugins/browse``): catalog search input
  per the design spec. Free-text matches case-insensitively on
  entry id, name, description, author, and tags. Debounced 300ms
  auto-submit so the URL stays shareable; ``?q=`` composes with
  the kind + tag chip filters.

## [0.59.0], 2026-06-21

Tier 4 (final) of the v0.56 admin-UI uplift. Onboarding and Themes
flip onto the section-card chrome, closing the four-tier arc.

### Changed

- **Onboarding** (``/onboarding``): the wizard step body card flips
  to ``.dx-section-card``. Every per-step "Back" link is dropped
  (per the spec: forward-only wizard with Skip as the escape
  hatch). The step-pip indicator + Skip setup link stay; pips were
  already polished in v0.54.1.
- **Themes** (``/themes``): the Update theme primary button swaps
  to ``.dx-btn-primary``. The bespoke 3-column layout + reactive
  live preview already track the form state, so the design's
  "preview updates as you edit" requirement was already met at
  v0.55 fidelity; no additional JS wiring needed.

### Notes

- Closes the 4-tier admin-UI uplift arc (v0.56.0 → v0.59.0).
  Every top-level admin page outside the composer + page editor
  is now on the shared ``.dx-section-card`` chrome + status pill +
  filter chip vocabulary.
- A page-level "the composer needs design love" follow-up is on
  the backlog; it has a custom interaction model that didn't fit
  the tier-based card uplift.

## [0.58.0], 2026-06-21

Tier 3 of the v0.56 admin-UI uplift. Schedules, Rotations, and the
System Settings sub-tab flip onto the section-card chrome.

### Changed

- **Schedules** (``/schedules``): Next 24 hours card, New schedule
  form, and Saved schedules table all wrapped in ``.dx-section-card``
  with the icon-in-teal-square headers + descriptions.
- **Rotations** (``/rotations``): existing-rotation cards + New
  rotation form lift onto the section-card chrome.
- **Settings → System** (``/settings/system``): every System tab
  card (Updates / Authentication / Backups / Webhook + auxiliary
  card--compact slots) converts to ``.dx-section-card``.

### Added

- Pragmatic CSS adapter for the legacy ``card_head`` macro: when a
  page wraps content in ``.dx-section-card`` but still calls
  ``card_head``, the existing ``<header class="card-head">`` markup
  re-styles to the v0.56 chrome (icon-in-teal-square + 15px/700
  title + meta + action). Lets Tier 3+ pages flip the outer card
  class without touching every ``card_head`` call.

### Notes

- The conditions builder partial originally scoped to Tier 3 was
  deferred: the existing ``condition-picker.js`` already drives the
  per-schedule + per-rotation-step builders and works at v0.55
  fidelity, so the surgical chrome conversion ships the visual win
  without rebuilding the picker. Picker UI overhaul can land as a
  follow-up.
- Tier 4 (Onboarding + Themes) still ahead.

## [0.57.0], 2026-06-21

Tier 2 of the v0.56 admin-UI uplift. Send, Events, and Widgets
Browse adopt the shared section-card chrome + filter chips +
inset-row vocabulary.

### Changed

- **Send** (``/send``): surgical chrome conversion. Tab strip kept;
  every per-tab card (File / URL / Webpage / Gallery / Live preview)
  now uses the ``.dx-section-card`` + ``.dx-section-head`` pattern
  with the icon-in-teal-square header. Push buttons swap to
  ``.dx-btn-primary``.
- **Events** (``/events``): new chrome — page-level filter chip
  strip (All / push / render / heartbeat / schedule / auth /
  plugin / transport / telemetry / conditions) + single section
  card with LISTENING indicator. Every event row becomes a
  click-to-expand button; the expanded body shows the raw JSON
  payload through the in-house JSON highlighter
  (``static/pages/json-highlight.js``). Rich conditions decision
  view (rotation steps, schedule outcome) preserved verbatim.
- **Widgets Browse** (``/plugins/browse``): outer card chrome
  flips to ``.dx-section-card``; Install / Update buttons swap to
  ``.dx-btn-primary``. The bespoke ``marketplace-card`` grid +
  screenshot carousel stays as-is.

### Added

- New ``.dx-event-*`` CSS bundle (event row + summary button +
  expand body + caret + type-specific icon tones).
- ``.dx-filter-strip`` + ``.dx-filter-chip`` reused across History,
  Events, and Battery dashboard so the three pages read as one
  filter-chip vocabulary.

### Notes

- The page-level click-to-expand on Events is the first user of
  PR 0's in-house JSON highlighter; ``<pre class="dx-code"
  data-json>`` blocks auto-highlight on DOMContentLoaded.
- Tier 3 (Schedules + Rotations + System Settings) lands the
  conditions builder partial as a new shared component.

## [0.56.0], 2026-06-21

First tier of the v0.56 admin-UI uplift onto the v0.54 ``.dx-*``
design system. Four list / dashboard pages flip onto the shared
section-card chrome + inset rows + status pill vocabulary.

### Changed

- **Dashboards** (``/pages``): flat saved-list inside a single
  section card, inline "New dashboard" name + create row, meta strip
  per dashboard (Size / Cells / Last pushed), Edit / Push / Delete
  inline. Drops the device-grouping accordion.
- **History** (``/history``): filter chip strip across the top,
  inset row per push with mono timestamp + device chip + colour-coded
  source pill + status pill + duration + Resend / Delete icon
  actions. Failed rows pick up the danger soft-band background.
- **Widgets index** (``/plugins``): per-kind section cards (Widget /
  Data / Font / etc.) with count chip + per-row icon + name + id +
  description + admin badge + "Open admin" ghost action.
- **Battery dashboard** (``/devices/battery``): page-level window
  picker as the v0.56 filter strip, single outer section card, per-
  device inset cards with name + mono id + Chart.js drain curve + the
  4-tile stat grid (Samples / Drain rate / Reaches 20% / Reaches 0%).
  Chart.js kept (per project decision).

### Added — shared infrastructure (PR 0 of the uplift)

- ``static/style/base.css`` gains the v0.56 token block
  (``--t-inset``, ``--t-accent-tint``, ``--t-pill-{ok,warn,danger,
  neutral}-*``, ``--t-code-{bg,border,fg,key,str,num,kw,punct}``) +
  dark-mode equivalents.
- ``section_card`` Jinja macro in ``templates/_components.html`` —
  ``{% call section_card(icon, title, description, cta, meta, id) %}``
  wraps the canonical chrome from v0.54 (icon-in-teal-square + title
  + description + body) so every page composes via one call.
- ``static/pages/json-highlight.js`` — in-house tokenizer (~50
  lines, no deps) that auto-highlights every ``<pre class="dx-code"
  data-json>`` block on the page; importable via
  ``highlightJson(str)`` for on-the-fly use.
- ``.dx-pill`` (status chip) + ``.dx-dow-pill`` (day-of-week chip) +
  ``.dx-input`` (input baseline) + ``.dx-inset-row`` +
  ``.dx-code`` (with syntax-highlight overlay) + ``.dx-meta-strip``
  + ``.dx-disclosure`` — shared primitives for every uplifted page.
- ``EventLog.last_event_by_target()`` — one-roundtrip MAX(timestamp)-
  per-target query used by the Dashboards list for "last pushed".
- ``History`` formatter now resolves ``target_devices`` (device
  name + icon) per push row so the device chip on the history row
  has real content.

### Notes

- Tier 1 of a 4-tier arc; Tiers 2-4 add the remaining pages
  (Send + Events + Widgets Browse, Schedules + Rotations + System,
  Onboarding + Themes).
- Battery prediction lands now even on devices with a mid-window
  recharge thanks to v0.55.1's segment regression: the bedside ESP32
  in the screenshot fixture surfaces ``-5.5 %/day`` + ``Reaches 20%
  14.5 days`` + ``Reaches 0% 18.2 days``.

## [0.55.1], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Deleted devices kept lingering on /devices/battery + the
  live status cache.** ``devices_delete`` already purged the
  smart-sync telemetry but not the battery history or the
  ``DEVICE_STATUS`` dict; the battery dashboard intentionally
  surfaces devices with stored history (so an offline-but-
  registered device still gets a card), which re-rendered the
  dead device. Adds the missing
  ``battery_history.forget(instance_id)`` + ``status_cache.pop()``
  calls + a regression test.

### Changed

- Per-instance device cards on Settings → Devices now collapse
  by default. Calibration-mid cards still open by default
  (the "which number is in the top-left" form needs to be
  visible without an extra click).
- "Built-in device kinds" card (the #22 prototype) is no
  longer rendered. The KindOverridesStore + routes + partial
  remain in the repo, ready for a future revisit once an
  admin workflow that's clearly better than editing
  ``devices/<kind>/device.json`` directly emerges.
- Discovered strip + unified Add device card moved INSIDE the
  flex container so they share the 16px gap with the per-
  instance cards (previously they sat as siblings to the
  section loop and had no inter-card gap).

### Added

- ``scripts/capture_ui_uplift_screenshots.py`` — playwright-
  driven capture for the UI uplift design handoff bundle.
  Boots an isolated testing-mode Tesserae on a free port, seeds
  a populated fleet (two devices, two pages, an interval
  schedule with HA/Sun conditions, a two-step rotation), and
  walks 15 routes including New-schedule-form + edit-form-with-
  conditions-open variants for Schedules and Rotations.

## [0.55.0], 2026-06-21

Settings → Devices tab adopts the v0.54 design system end-to-end,
closing the remaining UX backlog from the v0.54 handoff
(issues #16, #17, #22).

### Changed

- **#17 — Discovered strip splits by transport.** The single
  homogeneous list becomes a section card with two transport-
  grouped sub-strips: REST-announced (auto-claim on register)
  first, then MQTT-discovered. Each sub-group carries a count
  pill + a one-line explainer; empty groups vanish and the
  radar empty state takes over when both are empty. Row layout
  is identical across groups so the distinction is structural,
  not buried in a single pill.
- **#16 — Unified Add device card.** "Add device" + "Pair new
  device (REST)" + the standalone Pending codes table collapse
  into one ``.dx-section-card`` with a transport segmented
  control at the top (REST-default). Both branches stay in the
  DOM so typed values are preserved across flips. The REST
  branch surfaces pending codes inline; the MQTT branch shows
  a warning band linking to Server → MQTT broker when
  ``broker.host`` isn't set. Pair-code reveal moves from an
  inline block to a modal that shares its shell with the TRMNL
  token reveal so the two reveal flows look + behave the same.
- **#22 — Built-in device kinds card (new).** Adds an editable
  defaults layer per built-in kind under
  ``data/devices/_kind_overrides/<kind_id>.json``. UI is a
  collapsible row per kind with the editable fields
  (display-name default, panel preset, custom W/H, default
  rotation, default sleep interval) and an inline confirm bar
  for the Reset action. Override applied at load time so
  subsequent ``create_instance`` reads see the new defaults.

### Added

- ``app.state.kind_overrides.KindOverridesStore`` — JSON-per-
  kind store with a five-field whitelist + per-field coercion;
  empty saves remove the file (revert to bundled defaults).
- ``app.device_loader._apply_kind_override`` — merge helper
  that maps the override into the manifest's panel block + a
  pair of top-level default keys
  (``display_name_default`` / ``sleep_interval_s_default``).
- ``POST /settings/devices/kinds/<kind_id>/defaults`` +
  ``POST /settings/devices/kinds/<kind_id>/reset`` — save /
  reset endpoints with EventLog audit rows.
- ``scripts/capture_ux_screenshots.py`` — playwright
  capture script that boots an isolated testing-mode Tesserae
  on a free port, pre-populates the discovered + registered
  fixtures, and writes current-state PNGs into
  ``notes/design-handoffs/ux-backlog/reference/current-state/``.

### Notes

- Plugin-defined kinds aren't currently surfaced in the kinds
  card; the view-model carries a reserved ``plugin_source``
  column for the future. Out of scope per the handoff brief.
- The pair-reveal previously used a session-stashed inline
  block at the top of the Pair card. That block is gone; the
  same session key now drives a modal that matches the
  TRMNL token reveal's shape (close + copy + Done button).

## [0.54.3], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- **Dark-mode support for the redesigned cards.** The new
  ``.dx-device-card`` + ``.dx-section-card`` rules hard-coded light-
  mode hex values for backgrounds, borders, and text, so under
  ``<html data-theme="dark">`` they stayed white-on-dark and read
  as broken. Added a ``:root[data-theme="dark"]`` override block
  that maps every dx-* colour onto the existing slate ``--t-*``
  palette declared in ``base.css``. Smart Sync band keeps its warm
  tones (status indicator), the save bar stays dark (intentionally
  always dark), and the teal accent flips to its dark-mode value.

## [0.54.2], 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- CI mypy strict check rejected ``_humanize_signal`` in
  ``app.settings.index_routes``: the ``int(rssi)  # type:
  ignore[arg-type]`` line had an unused type-ignore (the failure was
  a ``call-overload``, not an ``arg-type``) AND the underlying call
  was still wrong because ``int(object)`` isn't a valid overload.
  Switched to an ``isinstance(rssi, (int, float, str))`` narrow
  before the ``int()`` call, so the type-checker sees a real branch
  with no escape hatch. Runtime behaviour unchanged.

## [0.54.1], 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Settings → Server: handoff redesign for the App fields.** Single
  "App" card replaced with seven grouped section cards (Network &
  integrations, Location & time, Quiet hours, Low-battery warnings,
  Display & performance, Widget marketplace, Privacy). Quiet hours
  + Low-battery carry their master toggle in the section header and
  dim the dependent controls below when off. The Network card pins
  a read-only ``NETWORK IP`` chip to its header. Sticky save bar
  matches the device-card pattern.
- **MQTT broker + Virtual panel cards adopt the same section-card
  pattern.** Icon-in-header + title + description + switches as
  full-row toggle rows + the same sticky save bar. The legacy
  external-vs-embedded broker show/hide JS still fires, just on the
  restyled markup.
- **The dx-section-card pattern is applied globally to Renderers and
  Widgets too**, so every settings tab shares one visual treatment.
  Side-effect: ``.dx-*`` rules are no longer scoped to
  ``.dx-server-area``, so plugin/renderer cards on the Widgets/
  Renderers tabs also get the teal icon-in-square header.
- **Description-text colours unified across the app.** ``.lede``
  steps to 13.5px / ``#7a7a74`` (the handoff page-subtitle
  treatment); ``.field-help`` steps to 12px / ``#9a9a93`` (matching
  the new ``.dx-toggle-row-desc``). All four description classes
  now share one colour family with a size hierarchy.

### Fixed

- ``settings_tabs`` Events tab labelled "Events" with the pulse
  icon (was incorrectly rendering as a second "Settings" h1 with
  the gear icon).
- ``rotations.html`` page header gains the arrows-clockwise icon
  and switches from ``<p class="muted">`` to ``<p class="lede">``
  so it matches every other top-level page.
- Stray "No system sections yet." paragraph removed from the
  System tab (the loop is intentionally empty there).
- Gap below the settings tabs is now identical on every sub-page.
  ``.settings-stack { margin-top }`` + ``.dx-server-cards
  { margin-top }`` were stacking with the tab bar's own bottom
  margin (32px instead of 16px on System / Server).

## [0.54.0], 2026-06-20

### Changed

- **Settings → Devices: per-device card redesign.** Each device card
  now opens to a tabbed layout (Status / General / Rendering /
  Schedule) instead of one long scroll. Status replaces the raw
  diagnostics dict with three humanized tiles, signal bars + dBm
  reading, mains-or-percent power label, firmware + IP, plus a
  Smart Sync panel with a confidence meter and a plain-English
  explainer. Editable controls live on General + Rendering; the
  Schedule tab pulls the per-device timetable. A sticky save bar
  reveals only when the form is dirty and animates in / out;
  Discard resets every field to its initial value.
- **Connection details disclosure.** Renderer id, instance-of,
  server URL, and the access token (with a Reveal button on REST
  devices) now collapse behind a "Connection details" disclosure
  at the top of the card instead of always taking up meta-block
  space. Transport flip moves into this disclosure too, so it sits
  next to the current transport label and confirms before flipping
  (issue #19).
- **Reveal full token (issue #20).** Admins who closed the
  one-shot reveal modal previously had to ``cat`` the on-disk
  manifest to recover the token; a "Reveal" affordance on the
  Connection details strip now POSTs ``/settings/devices/<id>/
  reveal-token`` (with explicit confirmation), stashes the token
  in the session reveal slot, and logs the reveal to the
  EventLog for audit.
- **Dormant MQTT meta hidden on REST devices (issue #21).** REST
  instances no longer surface the dormant ``status_topic`` /
  ``config_topic`` rows in the meta block; they keep on the
  manifest so a flip back to MQTT remains one click.
- **Server tab visual restyling.** Each card on Settings → Server
  picks up the handoff redesign's surface treatment (white card,
  ``border-radius: 12px``, ``0 1px 2px`` shadow, 22px padding) so
  the Server tab reads with the same visual hierarchy as the
  redesigned device card. Field-set grouping into 7 named
  sections is intentionally deferred.

### Added

- **Status humanization helpers** (``_humanize_signal``,
  ``_humanize_power``, ``_humanize_firmware``, ``_status_tiles``,
  ``_smart_sync_header``, ``_reported_panel_hint``) on the
  Settings index walker, with unit tests. Mains devices (Pi /
  ESP32 dev boards) now read as ``Mains · No battery`` instead
  of ``0 mV / 0%`` (which looked like a dead battery), and the
  Rendering tab carries a reconcile hint when the device-reported
  panel dims are swapped relative to the edit form because of a
  90°/270° rotation.
- **``static/pages/settings.js`` controller** (no framework, no
  build) wiring tab switching with querystring persistence, dirty
  tracking + sticky save bar, dependent-field dimming for the
  quiet-hours override, and a collapse toggle.

### Notes

- Device-card data shape on the section dict gains four fields
  (``connection_details``, ``transport_badge``,
  ``reveal_token_endpoint``, plus humanized fields under
  ``status``); the existing ``meta`` dict + the per-field branches
  in the legacy template stay in place so any out-of-tree callers
  rendering the old shape keep working.
- Backlog issues #16 (unify add forms), #17 (split Discovered
  strip), #18 (the device card restructure that landed here), #19
  (transport flip), #20 (token reveal), #21 (dormant MQTT meta),
  and #22 (per-kind defaults overrides) tracked the cleanup. #18
  through #21 are addressed in this release; #16, #17, and #22
  remain open.

## [0.53.2], 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **``GET /send`` returned 500 when any device's panel had
  ``w == 0`` or ``h == 0``.** ``device_panel(dev)`` builds a
  Pydantic ``Panel`` which validates ``w > 0`` and ``h > 0``, and
  ``send_routes._device_options`` iterates every registered
  instance and calls it without a try/except, so a single corrupted
  device 500'd the whole page. After the fix the bad device is
  skipped with a warning log and the rest of the fleet remains
  pickable.
- **The discover-and-claim flow no longer registers instances with a
  zero panel.** Firmware that reports ``panel_w: 0`` / ``panel_h: 0``
  in a ``/api/v1/device/discover`` POST (a default-int from a C
  struct that wasn't populated) now falls back to the kind's
  default panel instead of corrupting the instance. Fix lives in
  both ``app.settings.devices_routes.devices_register_discovered``
  and ``app.onboarding.register_discovered``.

### Notes

- An existing instance with ``panel: {w: 0, h: 0}`` keeps showing up
  in Settings → Devices (so the admin can fix it via Panel form) but
  is now skipped on /send so the page works again. Fixing the bad
  instance via the admin UI's Panel form (pick a preset or type the
  real dims) restores it as a send target.

## [0.53.1], 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **REST device "last seen" stuck at epoch 0.** The v0.52 REST status
  handler wrote a flat dict ``{... "last_seen": ts, "transport":
  "rest"}`` to ``DEVICE_STATUS``, but the Devices admin page's
  ``_status_view`` reads ``cache["received_at"]`` and
  ``cache["parsed"]`` (the shape the MQTT path uses). The mismatched
  field names meant REST device freshness always showed "20624 days
  ago" (now - 0) and the diagnostic-fields dl rendered empty.
- **REST devices missing from smart-sync telemetry and battery
  history.** The MQTT status path records to
  ``DEVICE_TELEMETRY`` (issue #10) and ``BATTERY_HISTORY`` on every
  heartbeat; the v0.52 REST path skipped both, so REST devices never
  appeared on the device_battery widget and the scheduler had no
  wake-prediction data for them.

### Changed

- ``app/transport_wiring.py`` gains a public ``record_status_heartbeat``
  helper. Both the MQTT subscribe callback in
  ``_subscribe_device_status`` and the REST ``POST /<id>/status`` route
  call this helper, so the live status cache update + telemetry +
  battery history + EventLog row + HA discovery notify all stay in one
  place. A future third transport can't drift the way the initial REST
  handler did.

### Notes

- The pre-fix REST cache records (with ``last_seen``) are simply
  overwritten on the next heartbeat with the correct
  ``{received_at, parsed}`` shape; no migration needed.
- Tests:
  - ``test_rest_status_updates_received_at_so_last_seen_is_fresh``
    pins the field contract.
  - ``test_rest_status_records_battery_history`` proves the
    BATTERY_HISTORY side effect runs.

## [0.53.0], 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Discover-then-claim flow for REST devices: zero typing on the
  firmware side.** New devices auto-register without pairing codes:
  firmware POSTs ``/api/v1/device/discover`` with its proposed
  device_id + kind + MAC; the entry appears in the Settings ->
  Devices Discovered strip; admin clicks Register on the card; the
  resulting instance carries the captured MAC + ``transport: "rest"``;
  the firmware's next discover POST matches by MAC and receives its
  ``device_token`` + ``config``. No pairing code typed, no flashed
  credentials. Mirrors the MQTT discovery UX (heartbeat -> admin
  clicks Register) but without needing a broker.
- ``POST /api/v1/device/discover`` extended with the MAC-match
  claim path. Response shapes:
  - ``{registered: true, device_token, device_id, config,
    server_time}`` when the MAC matches a registered instance.
  - ``{registered: false, discovered: true, retry_after_s, next_step}``
    otherwise. Firmware sleeps and retries.
- DiscoveryCache entries carry a ``transport: "rest"`` hint on the
  parsed payload when sourced from ``/discover``, so the admin's
  Register click creates an instance with the right transport (and
  the MAC) without further input.
- Settings -> Devices Discovered strip shows a green
  "REST, auto-claim on register" pill on REST-sourced entries so
  the admin can tell the new flow apart from the legacy MQTT
  discovery on the same strip.
- ``devices_register_discovered`` propagates the cached MAC +
  transport hint through to ``create_instance`` so the
  resulting REST instance is immediately claimable by the
  matching firmware.

### Notes

- The pairing-code flow (``/api/v1/device/register`` with
  ``X-Pairing-Code``) stays supported for users who want admin-
  driven gating before any instance is created. The discover-claim
  flow is the friendlier default; pairing is the stricter option.
- MAC matching is case- and separator-insensitive
  (``aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`` matches ``AABBCCDDEEFF`` matches
  ``aabb-ccdd-eeff``).
- MAC is not a secret (it's on the wire), but the security boundary
  is the admin's deliberate Register click. The rate limiter on
  ``/discover`` shields against a misconfigured firmware spamming
  the cache.

## [0.52.5], 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **CI red on the v0.52.2 onboarding-transport tests.** My new fixture
  in ``tests/test_onboarding_transport.py`` used
  ``create_app(testing=False, ...)`` which triggers the embedded amqtt
  broker startup when the MQTT-path test posts ``use_builtin=on`` and
  ``save_broker`` calls ``_rebuild_transport()``. Locally amqtt starts
  in <1s; the CI runner can't bind 1883 in time and the broker thread
  raises a ``RuntimeError: embedded broker did not become ready within
  5.0s``, which pytest surfaces as an unhandled-thread-exception
  warning that fails the suite.
  Fixed by switching the fixture to ``create_app(testing=True, ...)``
  matching the pre-existing ``tests/test_onboarding.py`` pattern.
  ``testing=True`` skips the embedded-broker startup the same way it
  does for the existing MQTT tests. The wire-shape persistence (the
  actual assertion target of these tests) is what they're testing,
  not the broker side.

## [0.52.4], 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Onboarding step pip showed an empty circle on completed-but-not-
  current steps.** The icon classname was ``ph-fill ph-fill-check-
  circle``; Phosphor uses ``ph-fill`` for the weight and
  ``ph-<icon>`` for the glyph, so ``ph-fill-check-circle`` resolved
  to no CSS rule and the ``<i>`` rendered empty. The branched-out
  digit (the step number) was also hidden, so completed steps in
  the progress bar appeared as blank circles. Fix is a one-word
  classname correction.
- **Onboarding welcome copy still listed "Broker" as step 2.**
  v0.52.2 reframed that step as a transport choice with REST as
  the default; the welcome overview and the progress-pip label
  were missed in that pass. Now reads "Transport" everywhere,
  with the inline copy explaining REST (no broker) vs MQTT.
  Wizard URL stays ``/onboarding/broker`` for backward
  compatibility with bookmarks and the ``save_broker`` route.

## [0.52.3], 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Phase 1c: ``transports/<id>/`` drop-a-folder discovery surface.**
  New ``transports/mqtt/transport.json`` + ``transports/rest/transport.json``
  metadata manifests + ``app/transport_loader.py`` that walks the dir
  at startup and exposes a ``TransportRegistry`` under
  ``app.config["TRANSPORT_REGISTRY"]``. Mirrors the pattern of
  renderers/ and devices/. The MQTT and REST implementations stay
  where they live (app/transport.py + app/transport_wiring.py +
  app/embedded_broker.py for MQTT; app/rest_api.py for REST); the
  loader is metadata + visibility, not a rewrite. Future third
  transports (WebSocket, gRPC, MQTT 5) can be added by dropping a
  folder and landing their implementation, no manifest field needs
  threading through five places. ``schema/transport.schema.json``
  validates manifests.
- **Per-device transport flip (MQTT ↔ REST).** New form on each
  device card on Settings → Devices: "Switch to REST" or
  "Switch to MQTT". Backed by ``POST /settings/devices/<id>/set-
  transport``. Flip preserves the device's id, panel settings, and
  per-clone renderer settings. MQTT → REST mints (or reuses) an
  access token and shows it in the one-shot reveal modal so the
  user can copy it into firmware. REST → MQTT drops the transport
  field; the token stays so flipping back is one click.
- **Transport column on the Devices area.** Each device card's
  meta block now shows the device's transport explicitly ("Transport:
  MQTT" / "Transport: REST" / "Transport: HTTP polling"). REST
  devices show the first 4 chars of their access token + "..." (so
  a screenshot of Settings → Devices doesn't leak the full token).
- **Rate limit on ``POST /api/v1/device/register``.** 10 failed
  attempts per client IP per 60s window; successful registrations
  release the bucket so a user pairing several devices in a row
  isn't penalised. 6-digit codes have only ~20 bits of entropy;
  this caps brute force at <1 attempt/minute averaged. Sliding
  window, in-memory, lives in ``app/state/rate_limiter.py``.
  Returns 429 + ``Retry-After`` header when exceeded.
- **``POST /api/v1/device/discover``.** Unauthenticated announce
  endpoint for firmware that booted but doesn't yet have a pairing
  code. Adds the firmware to the existing ``DiscoveryCache``; it
  shows up in the Settings → Devices Discovered strip alongside
  MQTT-discovered devices. Shares the register endpoint's rate
  limiter to prevent Discovered-strip spam.
- **Public docs for the REST transport.**
  ``docs/install/rest-transport.md`` covers the full end-to-end
  flow: when to pick REST vs MQTT, the pairing UI walkthrough, the
  endpoint reference, transport-flip semantics, security notes, and
  migration tips. Linked from ``docs/install/server.md`` and the
  mkdocs nav. The firmware prompts in ``notes/prompts/`` are
  referenced as the next step for porting existing firmware.

### Changed

- ``app/settings/index_routes.py``'s ``_device_meta_block`` branches
  on ``Device.transport == "rest"`` first, then the legacy TRMNL
  ``access_token``-on-instance signal, then defaults to MQTT.

### Notes

- The "drop-a-folder" pattern for transports is intentionally
  metadata-only. MQTT and REST have fundamentally different shapes
  (push vs pull, persistent connection vs HTTP request, broker-
  mediated vs direct). Forcing a common Transport ABC on them
  would be a fiction that obscures more than it reveals. The
  loader surfaces capabilities + identity; each transport's
  actual wiring stays where it makes sense in the app.
- Existing MQTT installs see zero behaviour change. The new
  endpoints, rate limiter, and UI controls are additive.

## [0.52.2], 2026-06-20

### Changed

- **REST transport Phase 2: REST is now the default for new
  installs.** Fresh installs no longer hit the broker setup detour
  on first boot.
- **Onboarding wizard reframes the broker step as a transport
  choice.** New top-level radio: REST (recommended, no broker
  needed) vs MQTT (broker required). REST is checked by default.
  Picking REST persists ``app.default_transport = "rest"`` and
  skips the broker save entirely; picking MQTT keeps the existing
  built-in / external broker flow. The wizard URL stays at
  ``/onboarding/broker`` for stability; the step's heading reads
  "Pick a transport" now.
- **Onboarding device step branches by chosen transport.** REST
  users see a Pair card inline (issue + show + revoke 6-digit
  pairing codes, same store the Settings -> Devices Pair card
  uses) instead of the classic MQTT discovery + add-device form.
  MQTT users see the existing flow unchanged.
- **``is_onboarded`` recognises a REST install as onboarded.**
  Without this, a REST user who finished the wizard would get the
  wizard again on the next visit (the legacy "has broker host?"
  signal never fires for REST users). Now ``app.default_transport``
  being set is the same signal.
- **New ``app.default_transport`` setting** under Settings -> App.
  Default ``rest``; pickable as ``mqtt`` for users who want MQTT
  as the new-device default after onboarding.

### Notes

- Existing MQTT installs see zero behaviour change. The wizard
  only runs on installs that aren't already considered onboarded;
  a real install with a broker host or a registered device skips
  the wizard entirely.
- The bundled embedded amqtt broker stays in tree and stays
  available, just no longer auto-enabled by the wizard's default
  path.
- Phase 1c (the ``transports/<id>/`` drop-a-folder loader
  refactor) deferred indefinitely. Pure infrastructure churn with
  no user-visible payoff until a third transport actually arrives;
  not worth the refactor cost now.

## [0.52.1], 2026-06-20

### Added

- **REST transport Phase 1b: per-device transport selection +
  Pair card UI.**
- **``Device.transport`` field on instance manifests.** New optional
  ``"transport": "rest"`` key, default ``"mqtt"`` for any pre-0.52
  instance (no rewrite needed on upgrade). ``Device.transport``
  property reads it; ``device_loader.load_instance_file`` propagates
  the field through the kind-manifest merge so a REST-mode
  instance keeps its transport choice across restarts.
  ``create_instance`` accepts the field as a kwarg, persists it on
  the manifest, and automatically mints an ``access_token`` for
  ``transport="rest"`` (with ``"native"`` strength: 20-char
  alphanumeric, stored in firmware flash, never hand-typed).
- **Push pipeline skips MQTT publish for REST devices.**
  ``PushManager._renderer_is_http_polled`` now returns True for
  either a kind with no ``status_topic`` (the legacy TRMNL signal)
  OR a per-instance ``transport == "rest"`` (the new v0.52 signal).
  Same kind can have MQTT instances AND REST instances; the
  transport field on each instance decides whether a publish runs.
- **REST ``POST /api/v1/device/register`` automatically tags new
  instances as ``transport: "rest"``.** Devices that arrive via the
  pairing-code flow are REST-mode from creation; no broker calls
  ever happen for them.
- **Settings -> Devices: Pair card.** New section sits next to
  Add device (which stays the MQTT manual path). Generates a
  6-digit code via the existing ``PairingStore``, shows a copy-
  friendly reveal, lists pending codes with their remaining TTL +
  the user's note, and lets the admin revoke any code mid-flight.
  POST endpoints:
  - ``POST /settings/devices/pair`` (issue)
  - ``POST /settings/devices/pair/<code>/revoke``
  Both session-gated. The ``/api/v1/device/admin/pairing/*`` JSON
  endpoints stay too, useful for curl-from-terminal testing and
  any future scripted provisioning.

### Notes

- Existing MQTT instances and existing MQTT clients keep working
  unchanged. The "transport" field is opt-in; missing field reads
  as ``"mqtt"`` everywhere.
- Phase 1c remaining: drop-a-folder ``transports/<id>/`` loader
  refactor that pulls the existing MQTT path + new REST path under
  one loader, mirroring renderers/ and devices/. That's a pure
  restructuring step for future-transport extensibility; no user-
  visible change.
- Phase 2 (default-to-REST onboarding + bundled-amqtt-not-auto-
  enabled) still to come.

## [0.52.0], 2026-06-20

### Added

- **REST transport, Phase 1: ``/api/v1/device/*`` endpoints landed
  alongside MQTT.** Background: amqtt 0.11.x has reliability issues
  for retained-message delivery, and the Mosquitto alternative is
  high-friction for new users (install service, edit config, generate
  creds, paste them into every firmware). The new REST transport
  removes the broker from the new-install path entirely; existing
  MQTT setups keep working unchanged. See
  ``notes/rest-transport-design.md`` for the full scoping.
- **Endpoints** (all auth via per-device ``Authorization: Bearer
  <token>``; same primitive TRMNL devices use):
  - ``GET /api/v1/device/<id>/frame``: returns the latest rendered
    frame's URL + format + panel dims + render id. ``ETag`` header
    carries the render digest; firmware sends ``If-None-Match`` on
    subsequent wakes and gets ``304 Not Modified`` when nothing
    changed (skip fetch + paint = save battery on Spectra 6 panels).
    ``204`` when no frame has been rendered for the device yet.
  - ``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/status``: heartbeat body parsed via
    the device kind's existing ``parse_status`` (same hook the MQTT
    path uses) and merged into the live ``DEVICE_STATUS`` cache, so
    Settings -> Devices shows REST-mode device freshness uniformly
    with MQTT-mode. Response piggybacks the current per-device
    config and a ``next_poll_s`` field telling the firmware when to
    wake again. One round-trip per wake; no separate config poll
    needed.
  - ``POST /api/v1/device/register``: first-boot pairing. Firmware
    presents an ``X-Pairing-Code`` header (the 6-digit code the
    admin generated via PairingStore.issue), the body declares the
    chosen device id + kind + panel dims, the server creates the
    instance and returns a per-device ``device_token``. Idempotent
    on the device-id-already-exists case (firmware retries get the
    existing token, not a duplicate). Single-use codes with 10-min
    TTL, in-memory only.
  - ``POST /api/v1/device/<id>/log``: optional client-side log
    line, appended to the EventLog so the Events page surfaces
    firmware diagnostics alongside server events.
- ``app/state/pairing_store.py``: thread-safe pairing-code store
  with TTL + single-use + constant-time compare. Pluggable in the
  app config under ``PAIRING_STORE``.
- ``app/rest_api.py``: the endpoint module. Mirrors
  ``app/trmnl_api.py``'s structure (auth helpers, registry lookups)
  but kind-agnostic so any device kind can be served over REST.

### Notes

- This is Phase 1 (REST beside MQTT, both transports active for every
  device). Phase 1b will decouple the push pipeline so a REST-only
  device skips the MQTT publish. Phase 2 flips the default in
  onboarding. See ``notes/rest-transport-design.md`` and the per-
  firmware prompts in ``notes/prompts/``.
- The Devices admin UI still issues pairing codes via the existing
  TRMNL token machinery for now; a dedicated "Pair new device"
  button on Settings -> Devices that wraps ``PairingStore.issue``
  is a small follow-up.

## [0.51.9], 2026-06-20

### Added

- **``scripts/install-systemd.sh``: optional follow-up to ``install.sh``
  that wires Tesserae as a systemd service on Linux** so it survives
  reboots + restarts on crash. Refuses on non-Linux / non-systemd
  platforms (macOS gets launchd separately). Generates the unit file
  from the install dir + port + current user, ``sudo`` installs to
  ``/etc/systemd/system/tesserae.service``, enables it (auto-start on
  reboot), and starts it now. Idempotent: re-running prompts before
  overwriting an existing unit. Env-var overrides for unattended
  installs: ``TESSERAE_DIR``, ``TESSERAE_PORT``,
  ``TESSERAE_SERVICE_NAME`` (rename for parallel installs),
  ``TESSERAE_USER``, ``NONINTERACTIVE=1``. ``install.sh`` now points
  Linux users at this script in its Done message, and
  ``docs/install/server.md`` has a "Run as a service (Linux)"
  section with the common ``systemctl``/``journalctl`` recipes.

## [0.51.8], 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- **Send -> Webpage no longer renders external URLs as a blank page**
  (most visibly with JS-driven SPAs, but the underlying defect cost
  every external URL a ~15s wait). Two compounding bugs:
  1. ``app/renderer.py``'s ``_screenshot_attempt`` waited up to 15 s
     for ``window.__tesseraeComposed === true`` on every render. That
     flag is set by composer.js after every dashboard cell mounts; on
     an external URL it never fires, so the wait always burned the
     full 15 s before falling through. Cost: every Send -> Webpage
     push waited an extra 15 s for nothing.
  2. The goto used ``wait_until="load"`` for every render (the
     composer-tuned default), which fires before SPAs have hydrated.
     For Reddit-style React-shell sites the screenshot captured an
     empty shell. The original ``networkidle`` choice was abandoned
     because composer renders stalled at it.
  ``RenderRequest`` gains an ``is_composer`` flag, default True for
  the composition path, set False by ``Push.push_webpage``. When
  False the renderer skips the composer-mount wait and uses a hybrid
  wait strategy: ``goto`` on ``load`` so ad-heavy pages don't hard-
  fail at navigation, then a best-effort 8 s
  ``wait_for_load_state("networkidle")`` so SPAs get time to
  hydrate. Sites whose networks never idle (analytics-heavy news
  sites) hit the wait_for timeout and we screenshot what's painted.
- **Caveat (not fixed)**: Reddit specifically still renders as a
  near-blank page because Cloudflare's bot gate serves an empty
  "You've been blocked by network security" page to Playwright,
  regardless of wait strategy. That's a server-side block on their
  side; routing around it needs either a stealth-flavoured browser
  build or RSS-style fetch path, which is a much larger change.

## [0.51.7], 2026-06-18

### Added

- **New device kind ``pico_bin_client`` + renderer ``pico_bin`` for the
  battery-powered Pico Plus 2 firmware** (``tesserae-device-pico-bin``,
  in development) that drives a Pimoroni Inky-style Spectra 6 panel
  over SPI. The split exists because neither existing kind matched the
  new firmware's needs: ``pi_bin`` packs landscape-native (correct) but
  publishes non-retained, and a deep-sleep client that just woke up
  would miss the current frame on first wake. ``esp32_bin`` retains
  (correct) but packs portrait-native (wrong for the Inky-library-style
  on-device rotation the Pico firmware does). ``pico_bin`` is byte-
  identical to ``pi_bin`` for the same input (content-addressed disk
  storage shares one file when both targets are active), but flips
  ``retain: true`` so freshly-woken clients see the current frame.
  ``pico_bin_client`` inherits ``esp32_client``'s ``sleep_interval_s``
  config schema + heartbeat contract (battery_mv / battery_pct / rssi /
  ip / sleep_until / next_sleep_s). Default panel is the Inky
  Impression 13.3" Spectra 6 (1600x1200 landscape).
- ``app/discovery.py`` and ``docs/dev/architecture.md`` now enumerate
  ``pico_bin_client`` alongside the existing kinds; the auto-generated
  ``docs/compatibility.md`` regen picks it up automatically.

### Changed

- **Settings: Renderers tab is now dev-only.** In prod every base
  renderer's user-facing settings (dither, saturation, contrast,
  calibrated) are already surfaced per-device-instance on the
  Devices tab via the ``device_setting: true`` flag on each field,
  so the base Renderers page was duplicate surface for the typical
  install. The tab is now rendered only when ``--dev`` is set so
  plugin authors poking at base-renderer wiring still have a UI;
  the route itself is unchanged so deep-linking still works in
  prod.

## [0.51.6], 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Marketplace install/uninstall queues a restart instead of asking
  the user to find a button.** A new "Restart required" button lights
  up in the topbar (rendered site-wide from ``_base.html`` via a
  ``marketplace_restart_pending`` context-processor flag) whenever
  one or more widget installs or uninstalls are waiting on a process
  restart. Click any number of Install / Update / Uninstall buttons
  on Settings -> Widgets -> Browse; the chip stays lit until you hit
  it, which opens the spinner modal, kicks ``Updater.restart()``, and
  auto-reloads the page when the new process is back. Earlier in this
  release I tried an auto-restart-per-install model: it broke the
  "queue several widgets at once" workflow that users actually want,
  so this re-do scopes the single auto-restart wire to the explicit
  ``/plugins/browse/restart`` endpoint and treats install/uninstall
  as queueable.
- **``static/restart-form.js`` no longer crashes the UX when the POST
  itself fails.** The restart-after-submit handler used to land in
  the outer ``.catch`` if ``fetch(form.action)`` rejected with
  "Failed to fetch" (the server killing the connection before
  flushing the response, common when the Werkzeug reloader races the
  restart timer in ``--dev``, occasional in production too). The
  POST-level rejection is now squashed into a resolved chain so the
  ``/healthz`` down-then-up poll becomes the source of truth: if the
  server really is restarting, the modal transitions cleanly through
  ``Restarting -> Waiting for it to come back -> Up. Reloading``; if
  it isn't, the 120 s ``/healthz`` poll times out and the error path
  fires (now correctly attributing the timeout, not the POST blip).
- **Refactor**: the restart-form spinner-modal markup and its
  ``/healthz`` poll-and-reload script extracted out of
  ``templates/settings.html`` into a shared partial
  (``templates/_restart_modal.html``) and a static JS file
  (``static/restart-form.js``), both included from ``_base.html``.
  Any page that drops a ``<form data-restart-form>`` now inherits
  the full UX, which is why the new topbar restart chip works
  identically to Settings -> System's self-update + rollback.

## [0.51.5], 2026-06-18

### Changed

- **Footer links no longer leak host hostname/IP in the Referer
  header.** All three outbound links (GitHub release tag, Sponsors,
  dmello.io) gain ``rel="noreferrer noopener"`` so the destination
  never sees the Tesserae host's address. On loopback that was just
  ``127.0.0.1``; on LAN installs it could have been the host's LAN IP
  or ``tesserae.lan``-style hostname, neither of which we want to
  hand to a third party by accident. Attribution for the dmello.io
  link still works via UTM tags carried in the URL itself, those
  aren't affected by the Referer policy. The dmello.io URL also
  gains ``utm_campaign=tesserae`` so the dedicated Campaign panel in
  Umami breaks out Tesserae-driven clicks without having to pivot
  through UTM Source.
- **Footer**: the dmello.io link's external-link icon moves to the
  left so all three footer entries lead with their glyph.

## [0.51.4], 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **TRMNL battery samples weren't accumulating in history.** The
  battery-history hook in `trmnl_api._update_status_from_headers`
  (and the matching path in `transport_wiring._subscribe_device_status`)
  read `parsed.get("battery_pct")`, but TRMNL kit firmware only sends
  the `battery-voltage` header. `parse_status` lands `battery_pct=None`
  in that case; the LiPo-curve derivation runs INSIDE
  `merge_status_parsed`, so the populated value lives on `merged`,
  not `parsed`. Result: the hook always skipped the record. Fixed by
  reading `merged` for both the check and the values; same fix in the
  MQTT path so any future voltage-only firmware accumulates too.

### Changed

- **`/history` no longer fills with empty renders from quiet hours.**
  Rows with status `quiet` (every bound device in its quiet window)
  or `held` (schedule conditions kept the default page suppressed and
  no fallback was configured) are now hidden from the History page
  by default. A "Show skipped" chip in the filter row brings them
  back when you actually want to see why a slot didn't fire. The
  underlying events are still written to the EventLog and visible at
  `/events`, so nothing's lost. `EventLog.list` gains an
  `exclude_statuses` parameter for the new filter shape.
- **Footer**: GitHub icon now sits next to the version number; small
  Sponsor link (Phosphor heart) pointing at github.com/sponsors/dmellok;
  link to dmello.io with the external-link icon and a
  `?utm_source=tesserae_<version>&utm_medium=footer` tag so visitor
  analytics surface which Tesserae version drove the click.

## [0.51.3], 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Rotation conditions silently fail-opening in prod.** The
  scheduler tick's HA-state refresh runs in a background thread.
  ``ha_core.server`` resolves its base URL + token via
  ``current_app.config``, which is a request-scoped proxy and raises
  ``RuntimeError: Working outside of application context`` outside
  a Flask request. The exception was swallowed by the closure in
  ``app_factory._ha_get_states``, which returned ``[]``, and
  ``ConditionEvaluator.refresh_ha_states`` then replaced the cache
  with empty. Every condition's entity was then "not in HA cache",
  fail-open kicked in, and gated rotation steps fired regardless of
  the entity state. The manual "Test conditions" button worked
  because it runs in a request context. Fixed by pushing an app
  context inside the closure so the background thread can resolve
  ``current_app`` correctly.
- **Defence in depth on the same bug.** ``refresh_ha_states`` now
  refuses to overwrite a populated cache with an empty result. Logs
  a warning instead. Without this, a future closure-level swallow
  (or a transient HA blip that returns ``[]``) would silently fail-
  open every condition again.

### Changed

- **Events page condition rows**: dropped the green/red left rail on
  each step row in favour of a small pass/fail dot at the start of
  the line. Page ids are now resolved to friendly names via the page
  store (slug stays in the data layer so a later rename updates the
  display).

## [0.51.2], 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Drawer battery item leaking into the desktop top nav.** v0.51.0
  switched the mobile-drawer Batteries item from `<div>` to `<a>` so
  the indicator could navigate to `/devices/battery`. That made the
  generic `.topnav a { display: inline-flex }` rule beat the
  unscoped `.topbar-batteries--drawer { display: none }` hide rule on
  desktop (specificity 0,1,1 vs 0,1,0), so the drawer's icon + label
  + device list rendered inline in the desktop header alongside the
  popover trigger. Scoped the drawer rules to `.topnav` so the
  specificity matches, restoring the hide-on-desktop / show-in-mobile
  drawer behaviour.

, 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Drawer battery item leaking into the desktop top nav.** v0.51.0
  switched the mobile-drawer Batteries item from `<div>` to `<a>` so
  the indicator could navigate to `/devices/battery`. That made the
  generic `.topnav a { display: inline-flex }` rule beat the
  unscoped `.topbar-batteries--drawer { display: none }` hide rule on
  desktop (specificity 0,1,1 vs 0,1,0), so the drawer's icon + label
  + device list rendered inline in the desktop header alongside the
  popover trigger. Scoped the drawer rules to `.topnav` so the
  specificity matches, restoring the hide-on-desktop / show-in-mobile
  drawer behaviour.

## [0.51.1], 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **mypy CI on strict-typed modules.** `BatteryHistory.recent` had a
  bare `tuple` type annotation (no parameters) and
  `device_battery_routes.index` did `(names.get(i, i)).lower()` when
  `display_name` could be `None`. Both flagged by mypy --strict on the
  v0.51.0 push.

## [0.51.0], 2026-06-18

### Added

- **`device_battery` widget.** Dashboard tile listing every
  registered device reporting a `battery_pct` heartbeat. Sorted
  lowest-charge-first with critical/low/ok tone colouring, fill bar
  per device, optional days-to-empty estimate, container-query size
  tiers (xs through lg).
- **Persistent battery history.** New `BatteryHistory` SQLite store at
  `data/core/battery_history.db` writes one row per battery-carrying
  heartbeat. Both MQTT (`transport_wiring`) and TRMNL HTTP-pull
  (`trmnl_api`) hook into it, so every device kind that reports
  battery accumulates history.
- **`/devices/battery` admin page.** Per-device card with name + current
  percentage, Chart.js trace tied to `--t-accent` (theme-reactive),
  stats table (samples, drain rate %/day, projected days-to-20%, days-to-0%).
  Selectable window: 1d / 3d / 7d / 14d / 30d / 90d. Status dot
  in the top-right corner conveys tone without a screaming rail.
  Reachable from the existing top-bar battery indicator (single
  device → direct link, multi-device → "View charts & trends"
  footer link in the popover).
- **Linear-regression projection.** 8-sample minimum, returns no
  projection for flat/charging batteries (the slope is reported
  alone). Powers both the widget's days-to-empty line and the admin
  page's reaches-20%/reaches-0% columns.
- **Condition decision logging.** Every rotation tick that evaluates
  step conditions, and every schedule fire involving conditions,
  writes one `type="conditions"` event row with per-condition
  observed values, pass/fail, the time-slot step vs the actually
  picked step, and any fail-open reason. Surfaced as a new filter
  chip on `/events?type=conditions` with a structured "why" panel
  per row. Debounced so a quiet rotation doesn't flood the log every
  30 seconds.

### Changed

- **Rotation projection bar** now respects conditions: the band shown
  in each time slot is the step the picker would actually pick, not
  the time-naive cycle position. Slots where all steps gate out
  render with a diagonal "Held" stripe; slots where the picker walked
  past the original step get a small amber underline so the user can
  see "the cycle shifted here".
- **Rotation projection bar palette.** Replaced the warm-everything
  terra/ochre/sage/rose/mauve set with a monochromatic ladder built
  from `--t-accent` at five intensities so the bar reads as one
  coherent strip and tracks the active theme.

### Notes

- No downsampling yet; at the default 15-min wake cadence each device
  grows the store by ~35 k rows / year. SQLite is comfortable through
  multi-million rows, so we'll add a rolldown when a real install
  hits multi-year retention.

## [0.50.3], 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Manual "Fire now" button on rotations now respects per-step
  conditions.** The autonomous scheduler tick already walked past
  steps whose conditions failed (an `octoprint_printing == on`
  condition would skip the 3D-print step when the printer was idle).
  The manual Fire button called ``_fire_rotation`` straight from the
  time-based step index, bypassing the eligibility check, so a user
  hitting "Fire now" while the gated step was time-current would push
  it regardless of the entity state. Routed manual Fire through the
  same ``_pick_eligible_step`` path as the tick; the per-step
  "Play this step" button keeps its bypass since explicit per-step
  intent is the whole point of that button.
- **Rotation projection bar fills the full 24h window.** The timeline
  preview's inner loop was capped at 200 iterations, so a rotation
  with 5-minute dwells covered only 1000 of 1440 minutes (~69% of the
  bar). Cap is now proportional to the window so short-dwell
  rotations fill end to end.

## [0.50.2], 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Editing a rotation or schedule after saving any condition no
  longer 500s.** The edit form seeds its conditions textarea via
  `step.conditions | tojson`, and Flask's JSON provider couldn't
  serialise Pydantic v2 `Condition` instances by default. App
  factory now installs a `JSONProvider` that defers `BaseModel` to
  `model_dump()`, which fixes the form re-render and any future
  `jsonify(model)` use site. Regression test pins both /rotations
  and /schedules paths.

## [0.50.1], 2026-06-17

### Docs

- **Bulk-renamed every standalone repo** so widgets live at
  `tesserae-widget-<name>`, themes at `tesserae-theme-<name>`, and
  device firmwares at `tesserae-device-<name>` (dropping the
  `-client` suffix since "device" already implies it). 34 repos
  renamed; GitHub's auto-redirect keeps every old link working.
- **README, CHANGELOG, install docs, compatibility table, and
  community widget docs** updated to the canonical names. 136
  references across 15 files.
- **Compatibility / settings tables**: cleaned up 20+ blank cells
  that were rendering as a literal `, ` after the v0.31.0 em-dash
  sweep (em-dashes had been used as "N/A" markers).

## [0.50.0], 2026-06-17

### Licence

- **Relicensed from MIT to AGPL-3.0-or-later.** Tesserae core, the
  catalog repo (`tesserae-widgets`), every standalone client repo
  (`tesserae-device-pi-bin`, `tesserae-device-pi-png`), and every
  bundled widget repo all move together.
- **What that means for you:**
  - **Self-hosting Tesserae on your own hardware: no change.** Run it,
    modify it, share modifications with friends — same freedoms as
    under MIT.
  - **Distributing a modified version: must ship the source.** Includes
    network-hosted modifications, which the AGPL closes (the
    distinguishing feature vs plain GPL).
  - **Combining Tesserae with proprietary software you ship: AGPL
    obligations apply** to the combined work. Widgets that just plug
    in via the documented plugin API can keep permissive licences
    (MIT / Apache-2.0) as long as they don't ship Tesserae itself.
- **Why:** to keep the project ecosystem open. A closed-source SaaS
  fork wouldn't be a contribution back to the community, and AGPL is
  the established licence for ruling that path out cleanly while
  leaving everything else (self-hosting, study, modification,
  contribution) wide open.
- No code change other than the LICENCE file, SPDX identifier in
  pyproject.toml, and licence references in docs / README.

## [0.49.6], 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **countdown_date and year_progress now actually respond to cell size.**
  Both widgets used `@container w (max-width: ...)` style queries where
  `w` is a container *name* that nothing in the codebase declares. The
  queries silently matched nothing, so the size-tiered behaviour
  documented at the top of each widget (xs hides everything, sm adds
  the bar, md adds the grid, lg adds the meta footer) was never firing.
  Both widgets just rendered the largest variant at every cell size.
  Fix: drop the `w` name so the queries match the cell's own size
  container (set on every `.cell` element in the composer). No
  behaviour change for users who happened to be looking at a cell big
  enough to fit the largest variant; users with smaller cells will now
  see the appropriate compressed layout. Same root pattern caused
  spotify_top's side-by-side breakpoint to silently fail; fixed in
  the tesserae-widget-spotify v0.2.4 catalog release.

## [0.49.5], 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **Public URL no longer corrupts LAN device frame URLs.** Regression
  from 0.49.4. When the Public URL setting was set (e.g.
  `https://tesserae.example.org:8443`), the override middleware
  rewrote `HTTP_HOST` to the public host:port. The
  `_capture_http_port` before-request hook then captured that proxy
  port (8443) as `DETECTED_HTTP_PORT`, and the push pipeline built
  LAN render URLs as `http://<lan-ip>:8443/renders/…`. Devices
  (pi_bin, pi_png, esp32) trying to fetch those frames hit the
  reverse proxy's HTTPS port over HTTP and got 400 Bad Request, so
  no panel could paint a new frame. Reported by @dmellok after
  setting Public URL during Spotify setup.
  Fix: `_capture_http_port` returns early when Public URL is set,
  leaving `DETECTED_HTTP_PORT` at its real value (Flask bind port,
  default 8765). External browser-facing URLs still use the Public
  URL via the existing middleware; device-facing LAN URLs revert to
  the actual bind port.

## [0.49.4], 2026-06-17

### Added

- **"Public URL" setting under Settings → App.** Operator-supplied
  override for the URL Tesserae uses when building external links
  (OAuth callbacks, HA discovery image URLs, etc.). Use this when
  running behind a reverse proxy whose `X-Forwarded-*` headers don't
  reach Flask cleanly. NGINX Proxy Manager in particular ignores
  `proxy_set_header` directives in its Advanced tab unless they're
  inside a Custom Location block (an undocumented quirk that breaks
  ProxyFix's auto-detection); setting Public URL bypasses that mess
  entirely. Leave blank to keep the existing auto-detect behaviour.
- Example value: `https://tesserae.example.org:8443` (no trailing
  slash; trailing slash is stripped tolerantly). Malformed values
  silently fall back to auto-detect so a typo doesn't lock you out.

## [0.49.3], 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- **OAuth callbacks now build the public URL when Tesserae runs behind
  a reverse proxy.** Wired `werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix.ProxyFix` into
  the WSGI stack so `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` /
  `X-Forwarded-Port` from an upstream NGINX Proxy Manager, Caddy,
  Cloudflare Tunnel, etc. are honoured. Before the fix, plugin OAuth
  flows (e.g. Spotify Core) generated redirect URIs like
  `http://internal-host/plugins/spotify_core/callback` from the
  internal HTTP connection between the proxy and Tesserae, so the
  Spotify Developer dashboard rejected the redirect URI even though
  the user registered the correct public `https://...:8443/...` URI.
  Reported by @dmellok during HA add-on Spotify setup behind NGINX
  Proxy Manager on a non-standard external port.
- Trusts one proxy hop by default. Operators stacking multiple
  proxies can override via `TESSERAE_FORWARDED_HOPS=<n>`; `0` disables
  ProxyFix entirely (bare-metal installs where the headers could be
  spoofed by a client).

## [0.49.2], 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **TRMNL X devices now auto-provision at their native 1872×1404 panel
  size.** The native TRMNL firmware's `/api/setup` request only carries
  `ID / Content-Type / FW-Version / Model` headers; `Width` / `Height`
  are only sent on `/api/display`. Tesserae's auto-provision was
  reading the (absent) `Width` / `Height` and falling back to the
  original-TRMNL 800×480 default, so the composer would design the
  dashboard at 800×480 and the rendered PNG would come out blurry on
  the X's 13.3" panel (even though the `/api/display` path served a
  correctly-sized image, since per-request headers took over there).
  Setup now looks up panel dims from the `Model` header instead:
  `x` → 1872×1404, `og` / `TRMNL` → 800×480, anything else falls
  back to the original-TRMNL default until we add it to the table.
  Reported by @tommerty on
  [discussion #8](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/discussions/8).

## [0.49.1], 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **TRMNL pushes no longer require an MQTT broker.** TRMNL clients are
  HTTP-polled (`/api/display`), not MQTT subscribers, but the push
  pipeline was unconditionally calling `transport.publish()` for every
  renderer including HTTP-polled ones. On hosts without Mosquitto the
  publish raised `RuntimeError: transport not connected`, the
  latest-render pointer never got stamped, and `/api/display` kept
  serving the placeholder image. The pipeline now skips the publish
  for devices whose manifest declares no `status_topic`, lifting the
  broker requirement for TRMNL-only setups. Reported by @tommerty on
  [discussion #8](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/discussions/8).

## [0.49.0], 2026-06-16

### Added

- **At-rest encryption for connector secrets.** Manifest-declared
  `secret: true` fields (HA tokens, plugin API keys, etc.) are now
  AES-GCM-wrapped on disk and unwrapped transparently when the
  scheduler / push / fetch pipelines read them. Wire format
  `enc:v1:<base64(nonce||ciphertext||tag)>` carries a version tag so
  future algorithm upgrades are mechanical. Bootstrap secrets
  (`app.session_secret_secret`, `auth.password_hash_secret`,
  `broker.password_secret`) stay in their existing forms because
  they're key material or already hashed.
- **Key resolution.** `TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY` env var (64 hex chars =
  32 bytes) takes precedence; if absent, the box derives a stable
  key from the Flask session secret via HKDF-SHA256 with the info
  string `b"tesserae.secret_box.v1"`. The fallback logs at info on
  first use so the operator can promote to an env-pinned key later.
- **Two new widgets.** `Countdown, Date` (large N days / hours hero
  against a target date, friendly meta line with the formatted date)
  and `Year, Progress` (year-in-weeks or life-in-weeks dot grid with
  a percentage hero). Both pure client-side, no network.

### Internals

- New `app.secret_box` module wrapping PyCA `cryptography`'s AESGCM
  + HKDF primitives.
- `SettingsStore` gains an optional `secret_box=` constructor arg
  and a `set_secret_box()` injector. Wrap-on-write / unwrap-on-read
  is transparent to consumers (`get_for_runtime`, `get_for_admin`,
  `update_for_namespace`); `get_section` recursively unwraps any
  `_secret`-suffixed string at any depth so plugin server modules
  that read their own state directly (e.g. `ha_core`) keep seeing
  plaintext.
- Legacy plaintext values keep reading (unwrap is a no-op for
  non-prefixed input). Migration to ciphertext happens
  opportunistically on the next save; no separate walker.
- Wrong-key reads raise `SecretBoxError` rather than silently
  returning an empty string, so a misconfigured `TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY`
  surfaces immediately instead of as a 401 from HA.
- Added `cryptography>=42,<46` as a runtime dependency. Rust-backed
  primitives, available as a manylinux wheel so the Docker base
  image stays slim.

### Upgrade notes

- **Upgrading 0.48.x → 0.49.0 needs no action.** Existing plaintext
  secrets in `settings.json` keep working (the unwrap path is a no-op
  for non-prefixed input). They migrate to ciphertext the next time
  you Save any setting under Plugins / Renderers / Devices.
- **Migrating to a new install works out of the box for the default
  setup.** The built-in Backups and Migrate flows include
  `settings.json`, which carries the session secret the fallback key
  is derived from. Same secret on both machines means the same
  decryption key, so connector secrets keep working after import.
- **If you set `TESSERAE_SECRET_KEY`**, copy that env var to the new
  install before importing the data zip. The key lives in your
  environment, not in `data/`, so without it the new machine derives
  a different key and connector secrets won't decrypt. Pinning the
  key is recommended for real installs (`openssl rand -hex 32`)
  because rotating the session secret then won't lock you out of
  your own connectors.
- **Downgrading 0.49.0 → 0.48.x.** Any secret re-saved on 0.49 is
  stored as `enc:v1:<base64>` on disk; an older Tesserae would read
  that literal string as your HA token and fail to authenticate. To
  downgrade, either restore `settings.json` from a pre-0.49 backup
  or re-save each affected secret in the older version.

## [0.48.6], 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Running-state pills on Schedules and Rotations.** The State column
  on the Schedules table and each Rotation card now surfaces what the
  scheduler is actually doing for that record, rather than just
  enabled / disabled. New states: `active` (last fire sent),
  `fallback` (conditions failed, fallback page pushed), `held`
  (silently skipped because conditions failed), `quiet hours`,
  `failed`, and `pending` (no tick yet since process start). Each
  pill carries a tooltip with the underlying reason so the user
  doesn't need to tail the event log to find out why a schedule
  isn't firing.
- Endpoint tests for `GET /api/conditions/ha-entities` covering the
  happy path plus three graceful-fallback branches (no `ha_core`
  installed, `get_states()` raises, `PLUGIN_REGISTRY` absent).

### Changed

- Rotation 24-hour timeline bands now use a warm five-hue palette
  (terra, honey, sage, dusty rose, dusty mauve) instead of the
  Material-style primaries. Reads more harmoniously against the
  brand terracotta accent and stops the bar from competing with the
  card content.
- Schedule editor's "Conditions + fallback page" block now sits as a
  full-width row below Smart sync instead of being squeezed into the
  three-column form grid, so the condition picker and fallback select
  have room to breathe.

### Internals

- `Scheduler.status()` now also returns `last_status` + `last_reason`
  per schedule; new `Scheduler.rotation_status()` exposes the same
  shape for rotations. Both are populated on every `_fire` /
  `_fire_rotation` and when `_pick_eligible_step` returns no
  eligible step.
- New `.pill` base + tone modifiers (`is-ok`, `is-warn`, `is-danger`,
  `is-accent`, `is-held`) in `static/style/schedules.css`; the
  previously implicit pill styling is now spelled out.

## [0.48.0], 2026-06-16

### Added

- **Conditional schedules and rotations.** Schedules and rotation
  steps can now declare zero or more `Condition` rows that the
  scheduler evaluates at fire time. All conditions on a schedule or
  step are AND'd; an unmet condition routes the schedule to its
  optional `fallback_page_id` (or skips silently if unset), and an
  unmet condition on a rotation step advances to the next eligible
  step. Three source kinds are supported: `ha_entity` (state /
  numeric / `in` / `present_within_seconds` against any HA entity),
  `time_window` (HH:MM wall-clock window with optional weekday
  mask), and `sun` (`before_sunrise`, `after_sunset`, `is_day`,
  `is_night` with optional minute offset, computed locally from
  `settings.app.latitude` + `longitude` so no extra HA call). The
  evaluator's HA state cache is refreshed once per scheduler tick;
  HA-unreachable falls open so dashboards keep refreshing on the
  existing cadence.
- **Rotation routing modes.** New `mode: "scheduled" | "priority"`
  on rotations. `scheduled` (default) keeps the existing time-based
  cycle but skips steps with failing conditions; `priority` ignores
  step durations and always pushes the first step in declared order
  whose conditions are met (a step with no conditions becomes the
  always-on fallback). Existing rotations default to `scheduled`
  with empty conditions, so behaviour is unchanged until you opt
  in.
- **Per-rotation flap protection.** New `min_hold_minutes` on
  rotations (default 5 min) gates step transitions so a HA sensor
  oscillating near a numeric threshold can't thrash the displayed
  page. Manual "play step N" overrides bypass the gate.
- **`POST /api/conditions/test` endpoint** for the schedule and
  rotation editor's preview button. Accepts a JSON array of
  condition dicts, refreshes the HA state cache, returns a
  per-condition `{passed, observed, reason}` so the user can see
  exactly which condition would fail and why.
- **`"held"` push status** so the History event log can distinguish
  "schedule didn't fire because conditions" from "schedule fired but
  failed". Held schedules with no fallback skip the History row
  entirely (INFO log only) to keep the audit trail focused on
  actual pushes.

### Changed

- Schedule + rotation editor forms expose conditions as a raw JSON
  textarea for the 0.48.0 ship. The full Bauhaus condition picker
  (entity autocomplete, operator dropdown, value type-shifting) lands
  in 0.48.1; the JSON path is the underlying contract so any picker
  UI just produces the same payload shape.

### Internals

- `app/state/conditions.py` carries the per-source-kind validators;
  `app/scheduler_conditions.py` owns the evaluator + a locally-computed
  sunrise/sunset (NOAA-style approximation, no `astral` dep).
- `Scheduler.__init__` gained an optional `condition_evaluator`. Tests
  that pass `None` keep the legacy "all conditions pass" behaviour so
  the existing 34-test scheduler suite required no updates.
- New tests: `tests/test_scheduler_conditions.py` (11 scheduler /
  rotation integration tests) and `tests/test_condition_routes.py`
  (3 API endpoint tests). All 941 tests green.

## [0.47.17], 2026-06-16

### Docs

- **CHANGELOG backfilled for 0.47.11 through 0.47.16.** Those six
  patch releases shipped without changelog entries; this catches up
  the record. No runtime change.

## [0.47.16], 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **History rows for scheduler and rotation pushes now show the page
  name** instead of the raw hex id. The view's name-resolution was
  gated on `ev.source == "page"`, so manual sends got resolved but
  scheduler / rotation events stayed as hex slugs (`875b37e3a8c1`
  rather than the actual page name). The gate is removed; all
  `type="push"` rows go through the page-name lookup with the dict
  fallback covering URL / webpage one-offs. Follow-up to #15.

## [0.47.15], 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- **Blank scheduled and rotation pushes when a page uses the
  webpage widget (#15).** The widget mounts an iframe in a shadow
  root; the iframe is its own browsing context whose content load
  is not part of the parent compose page's network state. The
  composer's `__tesseraeComposed` flag fired the instant the widget's
  `render()` returned (synchronously, right after the iframe element
  was created), so Playwright screenshotted a blank cell before the
  iframe finished loading. Manual "Send page" worked most of the
  time because that path is `_push_arbitrary_url` and renders the
  source URL directly with Playwright's own load wait, bypassing
  compose entirely. Fix: the webpage widget's `render()` is now async
  and awaits the iframe's `load` event (capped at 6 s so a hung site
  doesn't pin the render). The composer already awaits each cell's
  render Promise, so `__tesseraeComposed` correctly waits for visible
  content.

- **`ValueError("unknown file extension: .tmp")` in the History
  thumbnail serve path.** The atomic-rename temp filename was built
  via `thumb_path.with_suffix(suffix + ".tmp")`, producing
  `foo.png.tmp`. Pillow's `save()` then inferred the format from the
  extension and raised. Cosmetic only (broken thumbnails in the
  editor's History view, not blank panels), but logged a Python
  traceback on every render. Fix: pass `format=` explicitly so the
  temp filename can't break format inference.

## [0.47.14], 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **mypy `--strict` regression in the
  `_github_commit_cadence` widget sample.** The sample's
  `sum(b["count"] for b in bars)` and `max(bars, key=...)` walked a
  `dict[str, object]` list, so mypy strict choked on the implicit
  `int()` calls. Compute the totals from the raw `seed: list[int]`
  directly and look up the peak by index; same payload, no type-
  narrowing dance.

## [0.47.13], 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Dev-gallery sample payloads for the seven new GitHub hero
  widgets + `devref_egress`.** Lets `/_test/widgets` render
  `github_star_count`, `github_streak`, `github_pr_count`,
  `github_ci_status`, `github_star_growth`,
  `github_activity_heatmap`, `github_commit_cadence`, and the
  network-egress contract demo without needing a live GitHub token
  or unrestricted network egress. Gallery-only; no runtime change to
  the host.

## [0.47.12], 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **Community and user themes were shown correctly in the live
  preview but rendered as the Light fallback when pushed to a
  panel.** The `/compose/<id>` route bypasses the auth gate from
  loopback so the in-process Playwright renderer can fetch it without
  a session. The template references `/themes/user.css` and
  `/themes/community.css` via `<link>` tags, but those endpoints
  weren't on the loopback allowlist, so Playwright's subresource
  fetches got redirected to `/login` and the panel render fell back
  to bundled tokens only. The editor's iframe carries an authed
  session cookie which is why preview worked. Fix: add both theme
  CSS endpoints to `_LOOPBACK_PATHS` in `app/auth.py` + regression
  tests.

## [0.47.11], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Kind filter chips on the marketplace Browse page.** Splits
  Widgets / Themes / Fonts with per-type counts and icons; cross-
  filters with the existing tag chips via shared query params. Sits
  inside the Filter card so the page structure doesn't change. The
  chip row auto-hides when only one kind is present, so a widget-only
  catalog looks identical to before.

## [0.47.10], 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **CI failures introduced in 0.47.8 / 0.47.9.** Two mypy strict
  errors: `CatalogEntry.kind`'s Literal didn't include `"theme"` so
  the install path's `kind == "theme"` branch was reported as a
  non-overlapping equality, and `community_themes.py` carried an
  unused `type: ignore` after the ThemeFamily literal was widened.
  Plus a catalog-side validate.yml fix that landed via the seed
  copy: the widget-bundle layout check ran on theme entries too and
  always reported "tarball contains []" because theme tarballs are
  flat `<id>.json` + `<id>.css` pairs, not plugin folders.

## [0.47.9], 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Vivid and Gradient theme families moved to the community catalog.**
  29 themes (tangerine, lime, cobalt, magenta, emerald, crimson, cyan,
  aubergine, mustard, teal-pop, hot-pink, lavender-pop, olive-pop,
  burgundy, forest + sunset, aurora, twilight, spectrum, coral, mist,
  sand, sage, linen, mauve, marble, glacier, honey, pearl) used to ship
  bundled. They now live as two opt-in catalog packs:
  [tesserae-theme-vivid](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-theme-vivid) and
  [tesserae-theme-gradient](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-theme-gradient).
  Install from **Settings → Widgets → Browse community widgets**. The
  packs ship the same theme ids and CSS blocks as the bundled versions,
  so dashboards already pinned to one of these themes paint correctly
  the moment the matching pack is installed. **Until you install the
  pack**, dashboards bound to one of those theme ids fall back to the
  Light theme. The bundled set is now down to 13 themes (Light, Sepia,
  Cool gray, High contrast, Paper, Newsprint, Vivid, Citrus, Arctic in
  Light; Dark, Nord in Dark; Bauhaus, De Stijl, Brutalist in Movement).

### Fixed

- **Catalog schema's `id` + `folders` patterns now permit hyphens.**
  Theme ids commonly use hyphens (`tonal-slate`, `teal-pop`); the
  schema only allowed `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$`, which blocked valid theme
  pack entries from validating. Pattern relaxed to `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$`
  in both `schema/marketplace.schema.json` and the seed mirror.
  Widget ids still use underscores by convention; nothing existing
  changes.

## [0.47.8], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Themes as a catalog `kind`.** Marketplace gains a third installable
  kind alongside `widget` and `font`. Tarball convention is flat: each
  theme is two files at the envelope root, named by id (`<id>.json` +
  `<id>.css`). Single-theme entries ship one pair; **packs** ship N
  pairs and declare `folders: [...]` on the catalog entry mirroring
  widget bundles. The install path validates pairing, manifest-id ==
  file-stem, and `[data-theme="<id>"]` presence in the CSS; it refuses
  any id that clashes with a bundled Spectra theme. Installed themes
  land in `data/themes/community/<id>/theme.json` + `theme.css`. A new
  `GET /themes/community.css` endpoint mounts all of them after the
  bundled tokens + user themes in the cascade. The themes browse strip
  and the page editor's theme picker (page + per-cell) now surface
  community themes alongside bundled ones; the per-theme "Show in
  picker" toggle from 0.47.7 works on them identically. Detail pane
  treats community themes as read-only with a "from the catalogue"
  label and Duplicate-to-edit affordance, parallel to bundled themes.
  Backwards-compat: `InstalledRecord.kind` defaults to `widget` for
  pre-0.47.8 records.
- **`docs/dev/publishing-a-theme.md`** — contributor guide for
  shipping a theme or theme pack through the catalog. Covers the
  flat-file convention, the `theme.json` shape, the validated
  contract, and the PR flow against `tesserae-widgets`.
- **New `community` theme family** (and matching `From the catalogue`
  picker optgroup) for installed themes that declare a family outside
  the bundled set.

## [0.47.7], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Per-theme "Show in picker" toggle.** Tesserae ships 43 bundled
  themes; the page editor's theme select was a long scroll past
  themes most users never use. Each theme card now carries a small
  eye-toggle (open / closed) and the detail pane gets a matching
  "Hide from picker" / "Show in picker" button. Hidden themes drop
  out of the page-editor's theme picker AND the per-cell override
  picker, but the CSS block stays loaded, so any dashboard already
  using a hidden theme keeps rendering correctly. The themes browse
  page deliberately still shows every theme (with a "hidden" badge
  and faded card) so re-enabling never requires remembering an id.
  Stored as `settings.app.disabled_theme_ids: list[str]` — opt-in
  per Tesserae instance.

## [0.47.6], 2026-06-14

### Changed

- **Dashboards list groups pages by device.** Settings → Dashboards
  no longer renders one flat insertion-order list. Pages now bucket
  under the first bound device that still resolves, each section
  head labelled with the device name + icon + a small count chip.
  Within each section pages are alphabetical (case-insensitive);
  device sections are alphabetical by display name; an **Unbound
  (virtual panel)** section always sits last for pages with no
  device binding. Pages bound to multiple devices appear once,
  under their primary, with a small `+N` chip whose `title`
  tooltip lists the other devices. A primary device that's been
  deleted falls through to the next still-existing device in the
  binding list, so half-deleted topologies don't lose their pages
  to the Unbound bucket.

## [0.47.5], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`segno` as a host dependency.** Pure-Python QR code generator
  (~50 KB, no transitive deps). Available to any widget or
  renderer that wants to embed a scannable link without us baking
  per-plugin QR code into client-side JS. First consumer is the
  community `recipes` widget at
  [github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-recipes](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-recipes);
  any future widget can `import segno` directly.
  [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml).

## [0.47.4], 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Carousel preview for marketplace screenshots.** The community
  widget Browse page now renders multi-screenshot widgets as an
  inline carousel inside the existing 3:2 thumbnail, with prev/next
  arrows (revealed on hover/focus), clickable dot indicators, and
  native touch-swipe + keyboard arrow navigation via CSS scroll-
  snap. Single-screenshot widgets (every existing catalog entry)
  render byte-identically to before, no JS path, no new DOM nodes.
  Schema gains an optional `extra_screenshot_count: int` (0-9);
  when > 0 the catalog also ships
  `screenshots/<id>/extra-<n>.png` for n=1..count. The catalog-side
  CI (in the `tesserae-widgets` repo) verifies every declared
  extra exists with valid PNG magic bytes. Contributors who want
  to show off multiple widget states (playing vs paused, day vs
  night, sun vs rain) can now do so without leaving the grid.

## [0.47.3], 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Smart sync (JIT) for rotations.** The wake-aware fire gate that
  schedules picked up in issue #10 now applies to rotations too:
  when smart sync is on, a step transition is held until at least
  one bound device is within `smart_sync_lead_s` seconds of its
  predicted next wake. The step that ends up firing is whichever
  step is current at fire-time, so long wake intervals naturally
  skip intermediate steps the panel slept through (matching what
  the panel would render on wake anyway). Falls back to natural
  step-boundary firing when no bound device reports telemetry, when
  every device is still in the warm-up window, or when smart sync
  is left off. New form fields on the rotation editor mirror the
  schedule UI: a "Smart sync (JIT)" toggle plus a "Render lead (s)"
  input (default 10s, 0-600 range).

  [`app/rotation_routes.py`](app/rotation_routes.py),
  [`templates/rotations.html`](templates/rotations.html).

### Changed

- `Scheduler._smart_sync_should_wait` now takes
  `(page_id, lead_s, now)` so the rotation and schedule code paths
  can share one gate. Behaviour for the existing schedule call site
  is unchanged.

## [0.47.2], 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Two new B&W e-ink-ready themes in the Light family.** *Paper*
  is strict 1-bit (pure `#FFFFFF` canvas, pure `#000000` ink, no
  greys), best for 2-colour panels where any mid-tone dithers to
  noisy checker. *Newsprint* uses the same white canvas but admits
  a small greyscale hierarchy (muted/secondary text, hairline
  edges, light-grey sunken surface + accent-soft fills) so panels
  with grey support get tonal depth and pure-B&W panels render the
  greys as deliberate stipple texture. Both use the standard
  Helvetica Neue stack so typography stays a Style concern.

## [0.47.1], 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Editor: cell config/theme reverting after save.** When the
  editor needed to reload (binding/unbinding a device, plugin
  swap, layout-form submit, batch cell ops), unsaved cell-form
  draft inputs were dropped, so the last-typed prompt or theme
  override silently reverted to whatever the server had on disk.
  Every reload path now flushes all dirty cell forms first via a
  shared `window.tesseraeSaveAllForms` helper, and the editor now
  warns on raw browser reload while the Save button is hot.
  [`static/pages/editor.js`](static/pages/editor.js),
  [`static/pages/layout_editor.js`](static/pages/layout_editor.js).
- **Custom layout garbled when binding a second device with a
  different aspect ratio.** `_ensure_cells_fit_panel` was running
  a non-uniform rescale every time the primary panel resolved to
  different dimensions, so binding (or unbinding) a
  different-aspect device silently rewrote every cell's
  geometry, and repeated rebinds accumulated rounding errors
  until the layout looked random. The function is now a no-op
  unless the panel actually flipped orientation or the existing
  cells overflow the new panel. Paired with that,
  `resolve_panel_for_page` now picks the *largest* bound panel by
  area deterministically, so bind order can no longer swap the
  design canvas under an existing layout. A new "Refit to current
  panel" button in the layout editor's custom-layout details is
  the explicit escape hatch when you actually do want every cell
  proportionally rescaled to a freshly-bound display.

  [`templates/page_editor.html`](templates/page_editor.html).

## [0.47.0], 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Live rotation countdown + per-step "play now" button.** Each
  active rotation on Settings → Rotations now renders a live
  progress bar above its step list, ticking every second toward the
  next step transition. When the countdown hits zero the page soft-
  reloads so the server's recompute drives the next step's bar.
- **Manual step override.** Every step row gets a small play icon
  (visible on hover) that re-anchors the cycle so the clicked step
  starts at the moment of the click and subsequent steps follow at
  their normal dwell intervals — "play this dashboard now and
  continue from here". The override is in-memory only; a server
  restart resumes the rotation's anchor-deterministic schedule.
  Disabling or deleting a rotation drops its override.
- New POST `/<rotation_id>/play/<step_index>` route, new
  `Scheduler.compute_step_state` / `Scheduler.force_step` /
  `Scheduler.clear_anchor_override` methods, new `StepState`
  dataclass exposing the dwell-window edges for the template.

  [`templates/rotations.html`](templates/rotations.html),
  [`static/rotations.js`](static/rotations.js),
  [`static/style/schedules.css`](static/style/schedules.css).
- Six new tests in
  [`tests/test_rotation_scheduler.py`](tests/test_rotation_scheduler.py)
  cover the override math (jumps to requested step, continues from
  there, clears `_last_step` so the same-step case re-fires, raises
  on invalid index, GCs on next-day anchor, clears via
  `clear_anchor_override`).

## [0.46.10], 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Cleanup: removed the `_ai_brief` sample data from
  [`app/widget_samples.py`](app/widget_samples.py).** It was a
  screenshot-capture helper that slipped into 0.46.8 alongside the
  bundled-plugin noise; should never have been part of the released
  tarball. Removing now closes the 0.46.8 carry-over cleanly. ai_brief
  is a community widget published via the marketplace
  ([`dmellok/tesserae-widget-ai-brief`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-ai-brief))
  and the catalog-install path doesn't touch widget_samples.py.

## [0.46.9], 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Cleanup: removed `plugins/ai_core` + `plugins/ai_brief` + 30
  regenerated docs/screenshots/widgets PNGs accidentally committed
  in 0.46.8.** `ai_*` is a community widget shipped via the marketplace
  catalog ([`dmellok/tesserae-widget-ai-brief`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-ai-brief));
  it shouldn't be bundled. The screenshots got regenerated by an
  in-session capture run for the catalog's `lg.png` and slipped into
  the staging set unintentionally.

## [0.46.8], 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Plugin schema rejected `variables_textarea` field type.** The
  0.46.7 release added the `variables_textarea` macro + JS + CSS but
  forgot to add the new value to the `cell_options[*].type` enum in
  [`schema/plugin.schema.json`](schema/plugin.schema.json). Plugins
  declaring it would load-fail with "'variables_textarea' is not one
  of [...]" and the cell would render a "couldn't fetch dynamically
  imported module" error. Fixed.

## [0.46.7], 2026-06-13

### Added

- **`variables_textarea` field type** for cell options. Renders the
  textarea plus a click-to-insert chip rack grouped by category;
  clicking a chip drops its `{placeholder}` at the textarea's cursor
  position. Used by the new `ai_brief` community widget, available to
  any plugin that wants to ship a templatable prompt with discoverable
  placeholders. New macro in [`templates/_components.html`](templates/_components.html),
  JS at [`static/variables-textarea.js`](static/variables-textarea.js),
  styles in [`static/style/forms.css`](static/style/forms.css).
- **`home_lat` / `home_lon` injected into widget `ctx`** from the
  server-level home location (`app.latitude` / `app.longitude`).
  Widgets opt in by reading `ctx.get("home_lat")` as a fallback when
  the cell's own latitude/longitude is empty, so users don't re-type
  coordinates on every weather / sky / ai widget. The bundled
  `weather_now`, `weather_forecast`, `weather_hourly`,
  `weather_now_scenic`, and `clock_sunrise_sunset` widgets are wired
  to use it.

### Fixed

- **`auto_field` now passes `rows` and `placeholder` through to
  `textarea_field`.** Previously a plugin declaring
  `{"type": "textarea", "rows": 14}` got the macro's default of 3
  rows silently. Same fix applies to `placeholder`.

## [0.46.6], 2026-06-13

### Added

- **Star counts on community widget catalog cards.** Each entry on
  Settings → Widgets → Browse now shows a `★ N` chip next to the
  author byline when the widget's source repo has at least one
  GitHub star. The count comes from a `stars.json` sidecar published
  next to `widgets.json` by a GitHub Action in the `tesserae-widgets`
  catalog repo (hourly cron, `GITHUB_TOKEN`-authenticated GitHub API
  calls, only commits when counts actually change). Tesserae itself
  makes no extra GitHub API calls — every install reads `stars.json`
  with the same TTL as `widgets.json`. Cleanly fits the no-extra-
  telemetry stance. Sidecar 404 / parse failure is non-fatal: the
  catalog renders without the chip. New `CatalogEntry.stars` field
  defaults to `None`; the template hides the chip on `None` or `0`
  so widgets with no star data don't display "★ 0" as discouraging
  noise. See [`app/marketplace.py`](app/marketplace.py) for the
  sidecar fetch + merge, [`templates/plugins_browse.html`](templates/plugins_browse.html)
  for the chip, and two new tests in [`tests/test_marketplace.py`](tests/test_marketplace.py)
  covering the happy path and the sidecar-missing fallback.

## [0.46.5], 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Thin white border at the corner edges of the iOS home-screen
  icon.** The 180×180 `apple-touch-icon.png` was rendered with the
  brand's own rounded-square mask baked in, so the corners of the
  PNG were transparent. iOS then applies its own squircle mask on
  top, and the slight radius mismatch exposed a band of
  home-screen background colour wherever iOS's mask sat outside
  ours. Per Apple's HIG ("don't add a layer mask of an icon's
  shape to your image; iOS automatically applies an icon mask"),
  the apple-touch-icon now renders with `maskable=True` so the
  gradient fills every pixel edge-to-edge. iOS does the rounding;
  the corners come out clean. Other icons (favicon, HA add-on
  sidebar icon, social-card 512) keep the rounded mask since they
  display as-is. [`scripts/render_brand.py`](scripts/render_brand.py).

## [0.46.4], 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **Document the missing panels and firmware clients.** The 0.46.0
  `esp32_bw_client` + `esp32_bw_bin` work shipped but the README and
  docs hadn't been updated to mention them; the
  `tesserae-device-photopainter-7.3-bin` was in the README but absent
  from the install-a-client doc. README now lists 5 renderer plugins
  and 5 device plugins (was 4/4), includes the
  `tesserae-device-esp32-bw` firmware row, and the Waveshare panels
  table calls out the 4.2" B/W panel (Tested column intentionally
  blank — wire contract verified, awaiting in-the-wild feedback).
  `docs/compatibility.md` gains `waveshare_42_bw` preset, `esp32_bw_bin`
  renderer, `esp32_bw_client` device-kind, and a per-renderer test-
  status row marked `Untested`. `docs/install/clients.md` gains
  sections for both `tesserae-device-photopainter-7.3-bin` (confirmed
  on hardware) and `tesserae-device-esp32-bw` (with an explicit
  "untested in the wild" admonition), and the stale "all three
  clients" claim is replaced with a pointer to the compatibility
  table that gets actively maintained.

## [0.46.3], 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Proper home-screen icons across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Android, and
  Windows.** Tesserae now ships a 180×180 `apple-touch-icon.png`
  (the canonical Apple Add-to-Home-Screen / Add-to-Dock size), a
  192×192 PNG for Android Chrome, a 512×512 maskable variant for
  Android adaptive-icon launchers (rendered without the outer
  rounded-square so the launcher can mask to circle / squircle /
  rounded square without double-clipping the corners), and a
  `manifest.webmanifest` declaring all of the above plus brand
  colour and standalone display. The manifest uses relative
  `start_url` / `scope` (`../../`) so the same file works for direct
  hosting and HA Ingress. Added `theme-color` (light + dark),
  `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`, and
  `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` metas to
  [`templates/_base.html`](templates/_base.html). Registered
  `application/manifest+json` for `.webmanifest` in
  [`app/app_factory.py`](app/app_factory.py) so Alpine containers
  and Windows installs (where the system mime.types file may not
  include the entry) serve the manifest with the right Content-Type.
  [`scripts/render_brand.py`](scripts/render_brand.py) bakes all
  the new sizes from the same SVG source.

## [0.46.2], 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **Credit TRMNL + Terminus in the README and credits page.** Added
  explicit acknowledgment that TRMNL's open BYOS protocol is what
  makes Tesserae's HTTP-pull path possible, that Terminus is the
  reference server I aligned envelopes against, and that the
  rotations feature is a Tesserae take on TRMNL's playlists concept
  rather than an original design.

## [0.46.1], 2026-06-12

### Changed

- **Stop calling Seeed-built hardware "native TRMNL hardware".** TRMNL
  is the firmware / software; the physical devices are built by Seeed
  Studio running the TRMNL firmware. The phrasing made some folks
  read Tesserae as conflating the two. Swept all user-facing docs,
  manifests (`devices/trmnl_client/device.json`,
  `renderers/trmnl_png/renderer.json`), and load-bearing code
  comments (`app/auth.py`, `app/trmnl_api.py`, `app/device_loader.py`,
  `renderers/trmnl_png/renderer.py`) and reworded as "TRMNL devices"
  or "TRMNL device (Seeed hardware, TRMNL firmware)" depending on
  context. CHANGELOG entries left alone; convention is don't rewrite
  history.

## [0.46.0], 2026-06-12

### Added

- **New device kind `esp32_bw_client` + new renderer `esp32_bw_bin`
  for 1-bpp B/W e-paper panels.** Closes the loop on the
  `tesserae-device-esp32-bw` firmware (generic ESP32 + mono e-paper,
  canonical target Waveshare 4.2" 400x300, but the renderer + packer
  are resolution-agnostic). Before this, a device heartbeating with
  `kind:"esp32_bw_client"` showed up in the Discovered strip but
  one-click Register failed with "Unknown device kind", and no
  renderer emitted the strict 1-bpp wire format the firmware decoder
  demands (exactly `width * height / 8` bytes, 8 pixels per byte,
  MSB = leftmost, bit-set = white).
  - `app/quantizer.py`: new `pack_to_panel_bin_1bpp()` mirrors
    `pack_to_panel_bin` but for the 1-bpp wire. Same full dither
    suite works (Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, Jarvis, Stucki,
    Bayer 8x8, halftone, crosshatch, none).
  - `app/panel.py`: new `waveshare_42_bw` preset (400x300,
    landscape-native).
  - The device's `parse_status` extracts `panel_w` / `panel_h` from
    the heartbeat (with `width` / `height` as aliases) so any
    width-multiple-of-8 BW panel (296x128, 480x280, 800x480, etc.)
    registers in one click with the correct dims via the existing
    Discovered card pre-fill path.
  - Wire-contract tests lock the firmware byte format: all-white
    400x300 packs to 15000 bytes of `0xFF`; all-black packs to
    `0x00`; a single white column at x=0 makes every byte `0x80`.

## [0.45.7], 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Community widget gallery auto-refresh.** The community gallery
  (`docs/widgets/community.md`) is generated from the catalog repo's
  `widgets.json` on every docs build, but the docs workflow only
  fires on pushes to *this* repo. Catalog changes silently drifted
  behind the wiki. Two new triggers in `.github/workflows/docs.yml`:
  a daily cron at 06:00 UTC (zero-config, catches drift within 24 h)
  and a `repository_dispatch` listener (`catalog_updated` event) so
  the catalog repo can ping this one on PR merge for an immediate
  refresh.

### Changed

- **Community gallery refreshed.** Adds `calendar_schedule`,
  `fal_image`, `paperlesspaper_art`, and pins the latest versions
  of the other community entries (18 entries total, was 15 at the
  last deploy).

## [0.45.6], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Install guides: audited against current code, five real
  discrepancies fixed.** Onboarding wizard described as 3 steps in
  `server.md` (it's 5); timezone + HA discovery wrongly listed under
  Settings → Server (they're App-level fields); Backups vs Data
  export collapsed into one feature in `server.md` + `docker.md`
  (they're two separate `/settings/system/{backup,data}` endpoints);
  TRMNL MAC-based auto-provision (primary path since 0.44.1) missing
  from `clients.md` + `devices.md`; "Settings → Pages" and
  "Settings → Widgets" referenced in `devices.md` +
  `spotify-home-assistant.md` (they're top-nav entries Dashboards
  and Widgets, not Settings areas). Rotations mention added to
  `devices.md`.

## [0.45.5], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **History page: rotation source-chip now shows the shuffle icon.**
  Rotation pushes were already being recorded with
  `source='rotation'`, but `history.html`'s `SOURCE_META` had no
  entry, so the chip fell through to the neutral question-mark
  fallback. Added `rotation → ('Rotation', 'shuffle',
  'accent-ochre')` to the metadata map and included `rotation` in
  `history_routes.FILTERABLE_SOURCES` so the filter strip at the
  top of `/history` exposes a Rotation tab too.

## [0.45.4], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Rotations editor form: 4-column grid + equal field heights.**
  The `end_at` field's "leave blank to cycle until midnight" help
  text was a `<p class="field-help">` underneath the input, which
  pushed that column taller than the others and bumped Priority
  onto a second row. Help text now lives in the input's `title`
  tooltip; the grid is `1.5fr 1fr 1fr 1fr` so Name | Starts | Ends
  | Priority share one row at desktop, collapse to 2-up under
  960px and 1-up under 540px.

## [0.45.3], 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Rotations: optional `end_at` field stops the cycle at a
  wall-clock time.** Default behaviour is unchanged (cycle until
  midnight, re-anchor next day), but you can now set e.g.
  `anchor=09:00` + `end_at=17:00` so the rotation only runs during
  the workday and falls silent overnight. `end_at < anchor` is a
  wrap-around window (e.g. 22:00 to 06:00) matching the existing
  schedule semantics.

## [0.45.2], 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Rotations: drop the device picker; show each step's page-bound
  devices in the preview instead.** Each dashboard already binds to
  devices, so making the rotation re-bind was duplicate work and a
  source of confusion. The form's Devices section is gone; the
  read-only step preview on each rotation card now shows little
  device chips under the page name, so at a glance you see "step 1:
  Morning Briefing → Lounge + Kitchen panels." Empty bindings show
  a warning chip so you don't accidentally save a rotation whose
  step has no destination.

## [0.45.1], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Rotations editor: Add Step button now works.** The `<template>`
  element with the row markup sat outside the `<form>` (Jinja macro
  put it as a sibling), so the form-scoped `form.querySelector`
  couldn't find it and the click handler bailed silently. Moved the
  template inside the form so each rotation form binds to its own
  template.
- **Rotations editor: device picker now uses the same wide-card
  `device-checklist` style as the dashboard editor and Send page**
  (icon + name + dimensions per row) instead of the inline-chip
  fallback.

## [0.45.0], 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Rotations: cycle dashboards on a wall-clock anchor.** New top-nav
  entry next to Schedules. A rotation is an ordered list of
  `(page, dwell_minutes)` steps that loop on a daily anchor.
  Common ask was "show dashboard A for 30 min, then B for 30 min,
  repeat" or "morning dashboard 06:00, midday dashboard 12:00,
  evening dashboard 18:00." That now configures with a couple of
  clicks instead of needing six daily schedules.
  - Anchor reseeds at the configured `HH:MM` each local day, so long
    cycles don't drift across DST flips.
  - Day-of-week filter mirrors Schedules.
  - Priority field lets existing schedules preempt the rotation
    (e.g. a daily 09:00 schedule with `priority=10` overrides the
    rotation at 09:00 the same way it would override another
    schedule, eink shows the most recently pushed frame).
  - First tick after enable fires the current step immediately;
    subsequent ticks within the same step are no-ops.
  - "Fire now" button manually pushes whichever step the rotation is
    currently on, useful for previewing edits without waiting for
    the next transition.
  - New `rotation_routes` blueprint at `/rotations`, new
    `RotationStore` persisting to `data/core/rotations.json`,
    new `Rotation` pydantic model under `app.state.rotation_model`.

## [0.44.11], 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Dev gallery sample for `calendar_schedule`.** The new community
  widget (Google-Calendar-style agenda view, lives in
  `tesserae-widget-calendar-schedule`) would render blank in the dev gallery
  without an ICS feed configured. Bundling a synthetic
  school-week sample under `widget_samples` so users browsing
  `/_test/widgets` (and the catalog preview pipeline) see a
  representative frame without having to wire up calendar_core.

## [0.44.10], 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **Rendered frames now honour the app-level timezone setting.**
  Tesserae's preview iframe paints in the user's browser, so it picks
  up the laptop's local timezone. The actual frame pushed to the
  device is painted by a headless Chromium *inside the Tesserae
  container*, which previously read its timezone from the container's
  `TZ` env var (defaulting to UTC under Docker / the HA add-on). For
  users on Europe/London during BST, that meant clock + calendar
  widgets rendered an hour behind, even with
  `settings.app.timezone = "Europe/London"` configured.
  `RenderRequest` now carries a `timezone_id` field; `PushManager`
  reads the app setting on every push and forwards it to
  `browser.new_context(timezone_id=...)`. `"system"`, empty, or
  unparseable values still fall through to the container TZ (pre-fix
  behaviour). DST transitions are handled by the underlying
  `tzdata` package, so a BST→GMT change at the end of October will
  follow automatically without restarting Tesserae.

## [0.44.9], 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **TRMNL `Battery-Voltage` accepts decimal volts.** Some native TRMNL
  firmware sends voltage as a decimal string (e.g. `"3.86"`) instead
  of the integer millivolt form `"3860"`. Tesserae's parser previously
  only accepted the integer form, so `battery_mv` came out as `None`
  for those devices, which then meant no entry in the topbar battery
  indicator and no `battery` sensor in HA discovery. The parser now
  accepts both: any positive value below 100 is treated as volts and
  multiplied by 1000; everything else stays interpreted as mV.
  Threshold is unambiguous, a LiPo never reads in the 100-1000 mV
  range. Values of 0 or negative are rejected as sensor noise.

## [0.44.8], 2026-06-10

### Changed

- **`/api/display` envelope alignment with Terminus.** Three small
  corrections so any TRMNL-compatible firmware reads identical fields
  off Tesserae as it does off the upstream BYOS reference server:
  - `special_function` now defaults to `"sleep"` (was `"none"`).
    Native firmware branches on this; `"sleep"` is the documented
    "deep-sleep until next poll" signal, which is what the firmware
    expects when there's no admin action queued. The prior `"none"`
    value caused some firmware builds to stay in standby between
    polls, draining the LiPo.
  - New `maximum_compatibility: false` field. Per-device flag in
    Terminus; we ship `false` so firmware uses its modern features
    (partial refresh, etc.) by default.
  - `/api/log/` now parses Terminus's documented payload shapes
    (`{"logs": [...]}` and the nested `{"log": {"logs_array": [...]}}`)
    and surfaces each entry as its own log line rather than logging
    the raw request body as one blob. Unknown shapes still get
    accepted + raw-logged + a 200 response (firmware refuses to poll
    if `/api/log/` 4xxs).

### Added

- **Derive `battery_pct` from `battery_mv` on every heartbeat.** Native
  TRMNL kit firmware sends raw millivolts (`Battery-Voltage` header)
  but no percentage; that meant TRMNL devices were absent from the
  topbar battery indicator AND from the HA MQTT auto-discovery
  battery sensor. The merge step now runs a LiPo curve (4200 mV =
  100 %, 3300 mV = 0 %, clamped both ends, linear in between) when
  the firmware reports mV without an explicit pct. ESP32 + TRMNL
  panels that send both keep their explicit reading; TRMNL panels
  that send only mV gain a derived pct that flows through the topbar
  indicator and the HA `battery` sensor uniformly.
- **HA auto-discovery now publishes a `battery_voltage` sensor** for
  any device that reports `battery_mv` (voltage device-class, unit
  mV). Lets HA automations run off the raw value rather than the
  derived percentage. Lazy-published the first time a heartbeat
  carries the key, same pattern as the existing `battery` / `signal`
  / `ip` sensors.

## [0.44.7], 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Plugin `ctx` now carries `cell_w` / `cell_h`.** The composer
  hydrates every widget's `fetch()` with the cell's actual pixel
  dimensions alongside the existing `panel_w` / `panel_h`. Widgets
  that pull images from upstream APIs (e.g. the new `fal_image`
  community widget) can now request an image at the exact size
  they'll be painted at, instead of falling back to an aspect-ratio
  guess derived from the whole panel. Defaults to 0 / 0 in sample-
  mode and single-cell preview paths, so existing widgets keep
  working unchanged.

### Changed

- **Page editor: text inputs now defer preview refresh to blur, not
  keystroke.** The live preview in the dashboard editor still updates on
  every slider tick / checkbox flip / dropdown change, but text and
  number fields wait for the `change` event (fires on blur or Enter)
  before re-rendering the preview iframe. This matters for widgets
  whose `fetch()` calls a paid API (e.g. the new `fal_image` community
  widget on Fal.ai): typing a prompt no longer fires a generation per
  character. The dirty indicator + save-button enable still happen on
  every keystroke, so save flow is unchanged.

## [0.44.6], 2026-06-10

### Added

- **Inline schedules card on the page editor.** A new "Schedules"
  card now sits at the bottom of the editor column (last after the
  Dashboard, Layout, and Cell editor cards) showing the schedules
  pinned to this dashboard with their cadence, smart-sync state, and
  an Edit link per row. "Add schedule" links straight to the full
  schedules form with the dashboard already selected (new
  `?prefill_page=<id>` query param on `/schedules` opens the
  New-schedule form automatically). Empty state nudges you to add
  one when none exist.

### Changed

- **Mobile page-editor layout reshaped.** Below 1100px the live
  preview is now `position: sticky` pinned just under the global
  topbar so you can keep editing cells without losing sight of the
  rendered output. The "Live preview" title bar and the
  `1200 × 1600 · Lounge, Office` dims line are hidden at narrow
  widths to maximise the preview area in the sticky card. The
  page-editor header (Save / Send / Delete) goes back to being
  non-sticky on mobile so it scrolls away naturally; the desktop
  sticky-glass-blur behaviour is preserved.
- **README + docs drift cleanup.**
  - README's theme block called out "19 themes across four families
    including base16"; base16 was retired in 0.43.0 and the actual
    count is 41 themes across 5 families (Light / Dark / Movement /
    Vivid / Gradient). Fixed.
  - README's community-catalog mentions updated from 15 to 16
    entries (the new `paperlesspaper_art` widget published today).
  - README's "~790 tests" bumped to "~800 tests" (currently 802 in
    CI).
  - `.github/SECURITY.md` supported-versions table refreshed: 0.44.x
    is current at v0.44.5; 0.43.x rolled off to ❌.
  - `docs/widget-design-system.md` theme breakdown corrected
    (`7 Light + 2 Dark + 3 Movement + 15 Vivid + 14 Gradient = 41`).

## [0.44.5], 2026-06-10

### Changed

- **README images re-encoded with EXIF metadata removed.** Smaller
  files (`hero-rack.jpg` 600 KB → 387 KB, `widget-sizing.jpg` 325 KB
  → 193 KB), no other visual difference.

## [0.44.4], 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **README slimmed down.** Replaced the aged 0.20-era hero image
  with a new top-down shot of six different e-ink panels (framed
  Inkys, bare Waveshare boards driven by ESP32, a jailbroken
  Kindle), all painting different dashboards from the same Tesserae
  server. Moved the five admin / UI screenshots that lived inline
  in the README (HA hub, composition, paper calendar, bedside,
  widget sizing) to a new `docs/gallery.md` wiki page; the README
  now points at the gallery instead of carrying all five inline.
- **Wiki nav restructured for clarity.** New top-level "Gallery"
  page collects the admin UI shots. The two existing widget pages
  (previously "Gallery (bundled)" and "Gallery (community
  catalog)") are renamed to "Bundled widgets" and "Community
  catalog" so the word "Gallery" only means one thing now.

## [0.44.3], 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **TRMNL Add-device + token-reveal copy aligned with the 0.44.1+
  auto-provision model.**
  - The Add-device card now opens with an info paragraph telling
    users that **native TRMNL hardware** (XIAO DIY kit, commercial
    TRMNL devices) doesn't need the manual form, those clients
    auto-register the moment they poll. Only the **KOReader on
    Kindle** path needs a manual add (where the user types the
    access token on the Kindle's on-screen keyboard).
  - The one-shot token-reveal modal dropped its "or native TRMNL
    app config" line (no such app exists for BYOS) and now
    explicitly notes that native TRMNL hardware ignores this token
    entirely, the modal is purely for KOReader users.

  Copy-only fix; no contract change.

## [0.44.2], 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`/api/display` now auto-provisions when it sees a novel MAC.**
  0.44.1 made the box-fresh device flow work via `/api/setup`, but
  the official TRMNL firmware caches its `api_key` in flash and only
  hits `/api/setup` on first boot. A device that had already cached
  a bad / placeholder token (from a pre-0.44.1 Tesserae) would keep
  polling `/api/display` with that token, get rejected, and land in
  the Discovered strip — defeating the auto-provision flow.

  Now `/api/display` runs the same auto-provision logic when it sees
  a MAC (``Id`` header) that doesn't match any existing device.
  Result: any TRMNL client polling Tesserae with its MAC ends up
  registered after exactly one poll, regardless of which endpoint
  it called.

  The auto-provision helper is factored out so both `/api/setup` and
  `/api/display` use the same code path; no behaviour drift between
  the two endpoints.

## [0.44.1], 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Full Terminus BYOS parity: TRMNL devices auto-provision by MAC.**
  After reading the official Terminus reference implementation
  ([usetrmnl/terminus](https://github.com/usetrmnl/terminus)),
  Tesserae's flow was off in two ways:

  1. **Auth model.** Terminus authenticates `/api/display` by the
     `Id` (MAC) header; the access token is optional. Tesserae was
     auth'ing by access token only.
  2. **Pairing.** Terminus auto-creates the device record on the
     first `/api/setup` call. Tesserae was parking it in the
     Discovered strip and making the admin click Register.

  The result was that a box-fresh TRMNL device pointed at Tesserae
  needed an admin two-step before it'd actually paint frames — not
  the "BYOS = device just works" experience users expect.

  Now:

  - `/api/setup` looks up the device by MAC. If novel, auto-creates a
    full TRMNL instance with the MAC stored on the manifest, mints a
    20-char alphanumeric `api_key` (matches Terminus's
    `SecureRandom.alphanumeric(20)`), and returns the credentials.
    The device immediately starts polling `/api/display` with a real,
    recognised token; no admin click.
  - `/api/display` resolves the device by MAC first, falls back to
    access-token lookup for KOReader (which doesn't send a MAC).
    Existing TRMNL-on-Tesserae installs keep working unchanged.
  - The 5-char typeable token form stays for the KOReader path
    (where the user types the token on the Kindle's on-screen
    keyboard); the new 20-char form is only used for native
    auto-provisioning where the device stores the key in flash.
  - `/api/display` response envelope now exactly matches Terminus's
    shape: dropped the invented `pending_status_change` and
    `network_diagnostics_url` fields (introduced in 0.44.0 from
    second-hand BYOS docs), added the official `firmware_version`
    field, kept everything else. `friendly_id` still surfaces in
    both `/api/setup` and `/api/display`.
  - `/api/setup` response now includes a `message: "Welcome to
    Tesserae."` field to mirror Terminus's shape.

  Backwards compatibility:

  - Existing TRMNL devices using token-based auth continue to work
    (token lookup is the MAC-miss fallback).
  - KOReader Kindle path is unaffected; it never sent a MAC.
  - Admin still sees all auto-created devices in the Devices list,
    can rename / delete / regenerate tokens as before.

  Tests:

  - `test_trmnl_api_setup_auto_provisions_native_device_by_mac`
  - `test_trmnl_api_setup_returns_same_credentials_for_known_mac`
  - `test_trmnl_api_setup_koreader_path_falls_back_to_discovery`
  - `test_trmnl_api_display_envelope_matches_terminus_shape`
  - `test_trmnl_api_display_auths_by_mac_when_id_header_present`

## [0.44.0], 2026-06-09

### Added

- **BYOS protocol Tier 1: full compliance with the official TRMNL
  contract.** Any TRMNL-compatible client (XIAO ESP32-C3 DIY kit,
  native commercial hardware, KOReader Kindle) now talks to Tesserae
  exactly the same way it talks to the upstream TRMNL service.

  Concretely:

  - **`POST /api/log/level`**: BYOS log-level config endpoint
    acknowledged with `200 OK` + a `log_level: "info"` default. Some
    native firmwares refuse to continue polling if this 404s.
  - **`friendly_id`**: every TRMNL device now gets a six-character
    uppercase id (e.g. `7B3X9K`) auto-populated at instance creation,
    picked from an alphabet that omits ambiguous glyphs (0/O, 1/I/L).
    Surfaced in both `/api/setup` and `/api/display` responses so
    firmwares can show it on their setup / about screens. Older
    devices (pre-0.44.0) fall back to the instance id cleanly.
  - **Optional `/api/display` envelope fields**: `image_url_timeout`,
    `pending_status_change`, `network_diagnostics_url` are now in
    every response. Some native firmwares parse them; harmless to
    unaware clients (they ignore unknown fields).

  Tier 2 (firmware OTA) and Tier 3 (TRMNL recipe / plugin ecosystem)
  filed as [#11](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/11) and
  [#12](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/12); BMP format
  negotiation as [#13](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/13).
  None of those are needed for the XIAO DIY kit, native TRMNL, or
  KOReader, which all accept PNG.

### Fixed

- **`device_loader` now carries `friendly_id` through** alongside
  `access_token`. Without this, the field that `device_service`
  writes to the instance JSON would be stripped when the loader
  merges instance overrides on top of the kind manifest.

## [0.43.7], 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`ruff format` CI failure.** A late-breaking comment edit in
  `app/settings/devices_routes.py` had drifted from the formatter's
  preferred wrap. No behaviour change.

## [0.43.6], 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`/api/setup` now mints real tokens for unrecognised TRMNL
  clients.** The official TRMNL firmware contract is: device sends
  its MAC in the `Id` header to `GET /api/setup`, server hands back
  an `api_key` the device stores locally and uses for every
  subsequent `/api/display` poll. Tesserae was literally returning
  the string `paste-a-server-issued-token-into-your-client` as the
  api_key when the device's incoming token didn't resolve, which the
  firmware then dutifully cached as its access token forever. Now
  `/api/setup` mints a fresh short-form token, records a Discovered
  entry pre-populated with the new token + MAC + Model + panel dims,
  and hands the real token back to the device. The device transitions
  from "polling with a real token" to "polling with a recognised
  token" the moment the admin clicks Register in the Discovered
  strip — no firmware-side reconfig, no captive-portal revisit, no
  token re-entry. Matches the BYOS contract every official TRMNL
  variant follows (XIAO DIY kit, native hardware, KOReader Kindle).

  The placeholder-detection added in 0.43.5 stays in place as
  defence-in-depth (e.g. a non-official firmware that doesn't honour
  the `/api/setup` response), but the bug it was working around is
  now gone at the source.

## [0.43.5], 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Official TRMNL DIY-kit (XIAO-based ESP32-C3) headers parsed.** The
  TRMNL header parser now picks up `Id` (MAC) and `Model` (board
  identifier, e.g. `xiao_epaper_display`) and surfaces both in the
  device card's Diagnostics block alongside battery, RSSI, and
  firmware. Lets a glance distinguish the official DIY kit from a
  Kindle running KOReader.

### Fixed

- **TRMNL placeholder-token pairing UX.** A client polling with the
  firmware's literal placeholder token (e.g.
  `paste-a-server-issued-token-into-your-client`) used to be
  registered as-is, which left the new device's access secret a
  publicly-known string. Now the discovery layer detects placeholder
  patterns, flags `needs_pairing: true`, and the register flow mints
  a fresh token instead of preserving the placeholder. After
  registration the existing one-shot reveal modal pops with the new
  token AND the device's polling IP, so the user knows exactly where
  to paste it ("the device polled in from `192.168.50.125`, open its
  config UI there"). The Discovered card also gains a "Unpaired,
  click Register to mint a token" pill, plus `Model` and `MAC` rows
  for at-a-glance hardware identification.

- **Discovery synthetic IDs prefer MAC over token.** Previously the
  Discovered card's id was `trmnl_<first-20-chars-of-token>`, which
  drifted between reboots if the token changed (and looked weird if
  the token was a placeholder). Now keyed off MAC when the client
  provides one, so the same physical device always resolves to the
  same Discovered row.

## [0.43.4], 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Renamed "Add-on" → "App" in user-facing docs and prose.** Home
  Assistant rebranded "Add-ons" to "Apps" in its 2026 UI refresh
  (Settings → **Add-ons** → Settings → **Apps**; Add-on Store →
  **app store**). Updated the README, the install guides
  (`docs/install/home-assistant.md`, `docs/install/spotify-home-assistant.md`,
  `docs/install/server.md`, `docs/install/devices.md`),
  `docs/index.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, the SECURITY versions
  table to include 0.38–0.43, and two user-visible strings in
  `templates/onboarding.html` and `app/settings/index_routes.py`
  (the broker blurb).

  Companion `homeassistant-tesserae-addon` repo's README updated
  in lockstep.

  Internal references (Python code comments, log lines,
  `HA_INGRESS_MODE` config keys, the `homeassistant-tesserae-addon`
  repo slug, the `sync-addon` workflow name, the Supervisor
  `config.yaml` schema) stay as-is, those are platform-contract
  names and historical code paths, not user-visible labels.
  CHANGELOG history is preserved unchanged (the language was
  accurate at shipping time).

## [0.43.3], 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **`clock_word` capitalisation no longer mixes cases.** Phrasing
  tokens were stored ALL CAPS in `MIN_WORDS`; hours were Title Case
  in `HOUR_WORD`; the renderer `.toLowerCase()`'d the prefix and
  suffix but left the hour Title-cased, producing "twenty past
  Three" and "three o'clock"-without-apostrophe (the source said
  `OCLOCK`). Now every token is lowercase, the renderer
  capitalises the first letter of the joined sentence, and the
  word "o'clock" gets its apostrophe back. Output reads
  consistently as "Twenty past three" / "Quarter to eleven" /
  "Three o'clock".

## [0.43.2], 2026-06-09

### Removed

- **`firmware-prompts/sleep-until-clock-skew-fix.md`.** The firmware
  fix shipped on the user's ESP32 build; the handover prompt was a
  point-in-time artefact and is no longer needed in-repo. The
  defensive server-side fallback from 0.43.1 stays in place to
  protect anyone else who hits the same firmware-side bug pattern;
  the prompt itself is preserved in git history at the v0.43.1 tag
  if anyone needs the full diagnostic context later.

## [0.43.1], 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- **Smart sync: defensive fallback when `sleep_until` disagrees with
  `next_sleep_s`.** Real-world firmware (ESP32) was publishing both
  fields on every heartbeat, but the absolute `sleep_until`
  timestamp didn't match the relative `next_sleep_s` duration. The
  server-side priority chain trusted `sleep_until` first, so it
  predicted wakes 5+ minutes out for devices actually sleeping 60s,
  producing a constant `-307s` offset that never let confidence
  ramp.

  Server now checks `abs((sleep_until - received_at) - next_sleep_s)`
  on every heartbeat that carries both fields. If the disagreement
  exceeds 30 seconds, `sleep_until` is rejected as untrustworthy
  (almost certainly clock skew at compute time) and `next_sleep_s`
  is used for the prediction. A `WARNING` log line records the
  disagreement so the firmware bug stays discoverable.

  Firmware-side handover prompt for the underlying bug is at
  [`firmware-prompts/sleep-until-clock-skew-fix.md`](firmware-prompts/sleep-until-clock-skew-fix.md)
  in the repo.

## [0.43.0], 2026-06-08

### Added

- **29 new bundled themes + a Gradient family + a Vivid family.**
  - 4 vivid linear-gradient surfaces (Sunset, Aurora, Twilight, Spectrum).
  - 10 subtle gradients (Coral, Mist, Sand, Sage, Linen, Mauve, Marble,
    Glacier, Honey, Pearl) — each with bespoke accents derived from
    its own gradient hue, not a shared Light-theme palette.
  - 15 vivid flat surfaces (Tangerine, Lime, Cobalt, Magenta, Emerald,
    Crimson, Cyan, Aubergine, Mustard, Teal Pop, Hot Pink, Lavender
    Pop, Olive Pop, Burgundy, Forest) — brightened canvases with
    accents that harmonise with each canvas hue.
  - New `--surface-gradient` opt-in CSS token (falls back to flat
    `--surface`), so existing themes are unaffected and any future
    theme can paint a vivid gradient backdrop on `.w` cards.
- **Theme builder gradient support.** UserTheme grew
  `gradient_enabled` / `gradient_a` / `gradient_b` / `gradient_angle`;
  the Colour palette card has a "Card-surface gradient" switch + two
  stop colour pickers + a Tesserae-styled angle slider that live-
  updates the preview. The gradient subsection disables itself when
  the switch is off.
- **Mobile tab shell on the Themes page.** Below 900px the 3-column
  layout collapses to a tabbed view (Themes / Edit / Preview) so
  each task gets full viewport focus. Desktop layout is unchanged.
- **Tesserae-themed scrollbar globally.** 12px-wide, soft track
  (`color-mix` 14% of the foreground), rounded pill thumb in
  `--t-fg-soft` with a min-height grab target. Firefox + Webkit
  covered.

### Changed

- **Themes page UI polish.**
  - Colour palette card now lays each field as `label | swatch`
    (label left, 72×36px chrome-wrapped swatch right) instead of
    label-above-tiny-swatch. ~10 fields fit where 4 used to.
  - Gradient subsection's angle slider sits on its own full-width
    row below the two stop swatches, with a "Angle 135°" header
    line and a Tesserae-styled `.ts-range` thumb / track.
  - Theme strip is now `position: sticky` with a viewport-bound
    `max-height` and an always-visible scrollbar — no JS, no
    race conditions on read-only views, no "list runs past the
    palette card" overflow.
- **User themes appear in the page editor's theme picker.** The
  editor route was passing `user_themes=None` to `build_registry`,
  silently dropping every custom theme from the dropdown. Now
  pulls from `USER_THEMES_STORE` like the Themes admin route
  already did.

### Removed

- **base16 family + all 10 base16 themes.** Gruvbox / Solarized /
  Dracula / Catppuccin Mocha / Monokai / Tomorrow / One Dark are
  no longer bundled. Dashboards using a base16 theme will fall
  back to Light on next load; the equivalent code-editor palette
  can be rebuilt in the theme builder or pinned by saving the old
  values as a user theme before upgrading.
  `static/style/spectra-base16.css` is deleted along with the
  registry entries and template `<link>` references.

## [0.42.3], 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **README + bundled plugin descriptions refreshed for the 0.38–0.42
  state.** The README's bundled widget count went from 58 (pre
  slim-down) to 30 plus the community catalog, the top-nav rename
  ("Plugins" → "Widgets") propagated to user-facing copy, and new
  surfaces (smart sync, `design.palette`, `requires:` capabilities,
  marketplace install persistence) got mentions in the feature list.
  Five bundled plugin manifests (`calendar_day`, `calendar_week`,
  `calendar_month`, `picture_gallery`, `todo`) had a "manage at
  Plugins → …" hint in their description that's now "manage at
  Widgets → …". Auto-generated widget gallery regenerated to pick up
  the new text.

## [0.42.2], 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Marketplace widgets no longer wiped by Docker / HA Add-on image
  upgrades.** Prior to this release, `Marketplace.install` wrote new
  widget folders to the same path the bundled widgets live at
  (`/app/plugins/`), which is inside the Docker image layer. Every
  image upgrade (HA Supervisor pull, `docker compose pull`) replaced
  that layer, wiping anything the user installed via Browse community
  widgets while leaving the rest of `/data/` (pages, schedules,
  settings) intact.

  Now:
  - Marketplace installs write to `<data_root>/marketplace/<id>/`,
    which is on the persistent volume (`/data/marketplace/` in HA,
    `/app/data/marketplace/` in standalone Docker, `data/marketplace/`
    in bare-metal installs).
  - The plugin loader walks both the bundled dir (`/app/plugins/`,
    immutable, shipped with each image) and the user marketplace dir,
    merging the results. Bundled wins on duplicate ids with a logged
    warning so the admin notices and resolves manually.
  - Marketplace's install collision check also looks at the bundled
    dir, refusing to install a catalog entry whose folder name
    clashes with a shipped widget.

  **Migration for existing HA / Docker users**: marketplace widgets
  installed before 0.42.2 are gone from the filesystem (the image
  upgrade did that), but their `marketplace.json` records still
  exist. On the first 0.42.2 Browse visit, those entries show as
  installed but the actual code is missing; click Uninstall to drop
  the stale record, then Install to land the widget at the new
  persistent path. Future upgrades preserve installs.

  Bare-metal / git-clone installs aren't affected by the original
  bug (no image layer to wipe) but pick up the new path on upgrade
  too. Existing marketplace widgets at `plugins/` keep working until
  the user moves them to `data/marketplace/` (or just reinstalls).

## [0.42.1], 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **mypy strict on `app.state.device_telemetry`.** The 0.42.0 ship
  failed CI on a missed type annotation: `effective_interval` was
  inferred as `int` from the firmware-published branches but the
  no-signal else branch assigns `prev.last_sleep_interval_s` which
  is `int | None`. Added the explicit union annotation. No behaviour
  change.

## [0.42.0], 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Smart sync (JIT rendering)** — opt-in per schedule. When enabled
  on an interval schedule, the scheduler consults each bound device's
  telemetry-derived `predicted_next_wake_at` and fires within
  `smart_sync_lead_s` seconds of a trusted device's wake instead of
  on a fixed cadence. The rendered frame is waiting for the panel
  when it wakes, rather than being rendered after the panel paint.
  Falls back to plain interval firing when no bound device is
  trusted yet (warm-up window) or when the schedule has no device
  bindings. `interval_minutes` stays in force as a floor so smart
  sync can't push faster than the configured cadence. Tracked in
  [#10](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/10).

  Device telemetry plumbing:
  - New `app/state/device_telemetry.py` persists per-device
    derived state (`predicted_next_wake_at`, confidence counter,
    last-wake offset). One JSON file under
    `data/core/device_telemetry.json`.
  - `devices/esp32_client/device.py` parses optional
    `sleep_until` / `next_sleep_s` heartbeat fields. Firmwares can
    publish either for accurate predictions; absent both, the server
    falls back to the device's configured `sleep_interval_s`.
  - Heartbeats arriving within 10s of the previous one are
    debounced (some firmwares send a connect-beat + a sleep-beat
    per wake; without this, the second beat sets offset ≈
    -sleep_cycle and confidence never accumulates).
  - Confidence ramps on each on-time wake (±60s tolerance), resets
    on a miss. Three consecutive on-time wakes = trusted.

  Admin surface:
  - **Schedule list dot** (issue #10 follow-up request): green
    (active) / yellow (warming) / red (blocked) indicator per
    schedule row showing smart-sync readiness at a glance. Tooltip
    explains the current state.
  - **Schedule form**: smart sync toggle + render-lead input.
  - **Device admin card**: always-on Smart sync section with a
    plain-English reason line ("Last wake missed the prediction by
    Xs", "1/3 consecutive on-time wakes", etc.) so you can diagnose
    why a device isn't trusted yet.

### Changed

- **Widget card borders removed.** The 1px outer frame on `.w` is now
  off by default. The matting gap (page-level `gap` + the white
  `bleed_color` default that landed in 0.41.2) provides cleaner
  cell separation than a thin line that doesn't dither well on
  e-ink, especially around rounded corners. The `--edge-weight` +
  `--edge` Spectra tokens stay defined for anyone who wants to
  re-enable the frame in a custom style; `.w-title` and `.w-body`
  internal accents continue to use `--edge` for dividers. If your
  dashboard uses `gap: 0`, set a few pixels of gap or the cells
  will appear seamless.
- **`weather_now_scenic` light presets switched to dark text.** The
  three light-background presets (snow, partly_day, cloudy_day) now
  paint deep-navy / slate text on their gradients rather than white,
  so the temperature reads at a glance on every preset without a
  shadow workaround. The snow preset's gradient also brightens a
  touch and its snowflake glyphs flip to translucent dark blue so
  they show on the lighter bg.

### Fixed

- **Corner radius slider now live-updates the preview.** The editor
  was sending `corner_radius` in its postMessage patch but
  `applyPagePatch` in the composer never applied it; you had to
  reload to see the new shape. The handler now writes both
  `border-radius` and the `--cell-corner-radius` CSS variable to
  every mounted `.cell` so the preview tracks the slider live.
  Note: `gap` still requires a reload (matting padding gets baked
  into cell `x/y/w/h` server-side).
- **Battery indicator popover now dismisses cleanly.** Auto-closes
  5 seconds after opening (matches the flash-notification timing)
  and closes immediately on any click outside the indicator or its
  panel.

## [0.41.2], 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Widget inner border now follows the cell's corner radius.** When
  a page had a non-zero `corner_radius`, the cell rounded its
  corners + `overflow: hidden` clipped the inner widget's 1px border
  rectangle at the curves, so the border looked truncated at each
  corner. The cell now exposes its radius as a `--cell-corner-radius`
  CSS variable that crosses the shadow DOM boundary, and `.w` in
  `spectra-widgets.css` uses it as the default for its own
  border-radius. The widget's outer edge now curves to match the
  cell.

### Changed

- **Matting colour default → white.** Pages used to default to
  `bleed_color = ""` which fell back to `var(--bg)` (theme-following)
  and showed as black in the editor's colour picker (the macro's
  fallback). New pages now default to `#ffffff` so the picker
  starts on a sensible value. Existing pages with the empty default
  read as white in the editor too; rendering is unchanged for any
  page that already has an explicit colour set.

- **`picture_gallery` renamed for the widget picker.** Was "Gallery
  Core" landing under the "Other" group; now "Picture, Gallery" so
  the picker's split-on-comma convention groups it under Picture
  next to NASA APOD. Same widget, same id, no migration.

## [0.41.1], 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Browse page now lets you uninstall widgets that were originally
  bundled.** After the 0.38-0.41 slim-down, widgets that moved to
  the catalog still had their folders on disk for users who upgraded,
  but Browse showed "Install" (which then refused on folder
  collision) rather than "Uninstall". The marketplace now detects
  this state: when the catalog's declared folders all exist on disk
  but no marketplace record tracks them, the entry surfaces as
  "from a previous install" with the Uninstall flow enabled. Clicking
  Uninstall removes only the folders the catalog *currently* declares,
  never touches arbitrary plugin folders.

### Changed

- **Catalog badge wording: "official" → "verified".** "Official" read
  as an endorsement claim ("Spotify-official Tesserae integration")
  when the badge actually meant "reviewed + maintained by the catalog
  owner". Same shield icon + tooltip.

  Catalog-side companion: the `Spotify` and `GitHub` entries renamed
  to `Spotify Widgets` and `GitHub Widgets` to further disambiguate
  ("widgets ABOUT the service" rather than "from the service"). Other
  catalog entries with generic names (Finance, Sky, etc.) stay as-is.

- **`monitoring` and `picture_extras` bundles split** into single-
  purpose catalog entries: `glances` + `octoprint` (was `monitoring`),
  `unsplash` + `apple_album` (was `picture_extras`). The combined
  bundles lumped together widgets for very different audiences (a
  homelab user vs a 3D-printer hobbyist; an Unsplash fan vs an Apple
  Music user). Single-purpose entries respect those audiences. Pure
  catalog-side change, no Tesserae code touched for the split.

## [0.41.0], 2026-06-08

### Changed (breaking, but easy to fix)

- **Bundle slim-down completes: 18 more widgets moved to the
  community catalog, 7 new bundles.** The default install now ships
  ~30 universally-useful widgets instead of ~65. All moved widgets
  are installable in one click from Settings → Widgets → Browse
  community widgets.

  | Bundle | Widgets | Source repo |
  |---|---|---|
  | Finance | finance_crypto, finance_currency, finance_stock | [dmellok/tesserae-widget-finance](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-finance) |
  | Sky | sky_air_traffic, sky_aurora, sky_bom_warnings, sky_moon | [dmellok/tesserae-widget-sky](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-sky) |
  | Weather Extras | weather_air_quality, weather_pollen_count, weather_wind | [dmellok/tesserae-widget-weather-extras](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-weather-extras) |
  | Picture Extras | picture_unsplash, picture_apple_album | [dmellok/tesserae-picture-extras](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-picture-extras) |
  | Clock Extras | clock_qlock, clock_world | [dmellok/tesserae-widget-clock-extras](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-clock-extras) |
  | Monitoring | glances_core, glances_status, octoprint_status | [dmellok/tesserae-monitoring](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-monitoring) |
  | Public Transport | public_transport_times | [dmellok/tesserae-widget-transport](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-transport) |

  Dashboards that referenced any of these will show "widget not
  installed" cells on upgrade until you reinstall from Browse.

  Why: completes the slim-down started in 0.38.0 (F1), 0.39.0
  (Spotify), 0.40.0 (GitHub). The remaining ~30 bundled widgets are
  what a new user can compose a useful dashboard from immediately
  with zero accounts or niche knowledge: clocks, weather, calendar,
  todo, RSS / Hacker News / Wikipedia news, picture_gallery,
  webpage, and the Home Assistant family.

  Also in this release:

  - Browse Card screenshots now ship for every official bundle (the
    catalog declared `screenshot_sizes: ["lg"]` for f1/spotify/github
    in earlier releases but no PNG was uploaded, so the card showed a
    broken-image placeholder).
  - 4 dead `_sky_moon` / `_weather_pollen_count` / `_glances_status` /
    `_octoprint_status` sample functions stripped from
    `app/widget_samples.py`.
  - `docs/widgets/tiers.md` marks moved entries as *(marketplace)*.
  - `docs/widget-build-prompt.md` + `docs/widgets.md` archetype
    examples swapped from moved widgets to still-bundled equivalents
    so AI-built widgets read from valid file paths.

## [0.40.0], 2026-06-08

### Changed (breaking, but easy to fix)

- **GitHub widget family moved out of the bundle.** The seven GitHub
  widgets (`github_core`, `github_actions`, `github_activity`,
  `github_contributions`, `github_pr_queue`, `github_releases`,
  `github_repo`) are no longer bundled and live in the community
  catalog. Reinstall via Settings → Widgets → Browse community
  widgets → Install GitHub.

  Why: continues the bundle slim-down (F1 in 0.38.0, Spotify in
  0.39.0). All seven need a personal access token to do anything
  useful; the typical user, especially a non-developer HA user,
  never enables them. Marketplace is the right home.

  Source repo: [dmellok/tesserae-widget-github](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-github).
  Catalog entry: id `github`, official, bundle pattern.

  Also removed: three `_github_*` sample functions in
  `app/widget_samples.py`. The `docs/widgets/tiers.md` table marks
  the GitHub + F1 entries as `(marketplace)` so the stability tier
  doc still describes the upstreams accurately.

## [0.39.0], 2026-06-08

### Changed (breaking, but easy to fix)

- **Spotify widget family moved out of the bundle.** The four Spotify
  widgets (`spotify_core`, `spotify_now_playing`, `spotify_queue`,
  `spotify_album_art`) are no longer bundled and live in the
  community catalog. Dashboards that referenced them will show
  "widget not installed" cells on upgrade until you reinstall via
  Settings → Widgets → Browse community widgets → Install Spotify.

  Why: continuation of the bundle slim-down started in 0.38.0
  (F1). OAuth-required widgets aren't useful out of the box, every
  user has to register a Spotify Developer app and complete a
  connect flow before any cell renders. Marketplace is the right
  home: install if you want it.

  Source repo: [dmellok/tesserae-widget-spotify](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-spotify).
  Catalog entry: id `spotify`, official, bundle pattern (one
  install lays down all 4 folders).

  The shared `_SPOTIFY_ART_DATA_URL` sample placeholder + the three
  `_spotify_*` sample functions in `app/widget_samples.py` were
  removed alongside the folders.

## [0.38.0], 2026-06-08

### Changed (breaking, but easy to fix)

- **F1 widget family moved out of the bundle.** The five F1 widgets
  (`f1_core`, `f1_last_race`, `f1_next`, `f1_standings_drivers`,
  `f1_weekend`) are no longer bundled with Tesserae and instead live
  in the community catalog. Existing dashboards that referenced these
  widgets will show "widget not installed" cells on upgrade until
  you reinstall them via Settings → Widgets → Browse community
  widgets → Install Formula 1.

  Why: kicking off the bundle slim-down. F1 is genuinely niche (most
  users don't follow the sport) and shipping 5 widgets every install
  inflated the picker for everyone. Marketplace is the right home,
  opt in if you want them, ignore them if you don't.

  Source repo for the moved bundle:
  [dmellok/tesserae-widget-f1](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-widget-f1).
  Catalog entry: id `f1`, official, bundle pattern (one install lays
  down all 5 folders).

  This is the first family to move. More niche / interest-specific
  families will follow in upcoming releases (Spotify, GitHub,
  Finance, etc.); each one will carry a CHANGELOG note in the same
  shape so you always know where a removed widget went.

## [0.37.0], 2026-06-07

### Added

- **`design.palette` manifest opt-in** for widgets that want to use
  arbitrary CSS colours (gradients, layered shapes, soft shadows)
  rather than the strict Spectra colour tokens. Default stays
  `strict`; widgets declare `"design": {"palette": "extended"}` to
  opt in. Renderer behaviour is unchanged: extended widgets rely on
  the existing Floyd-Steinberg dither pass to approximate their
  CSS colours on the panel palette. Typography + spacing tokens
  remain mandatory regardless of the palette flag so multi-widget
  dashboards stay visually coherent.
- **`weather_now_scenic` widget**, the reference implementation of
  the extended palette opt-in. Pill-shaped card with weather +
  time-of-day theming across nine presets (sunny day, clear night,
  partly day/night, cloudy day/night, rain, snow, storm). Same
  Open-Meteo data path as `weather_now` (shares the WMO mapping)
  but a slimmer payload tailored to the scenic layout. Ships as a
  separate widget rather than a style switch on `weather_now` so
  the two can coexist on a dashboard and the bundled widget keeps
  its strict-palette guarantees for BW panels.

## [0.36.2], 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Capability hook no longer rejects every real network call after
  DNS.** The egress check installed two socket hooks (one on
  `socket.create_connection`, one on `socket.socket.connect`) so
  raw-socket use couldn't bypass the hostname allowlist. Problem:
  stdlib's `create_connection` does `getaddrinfo()` and then calls
  `sock.connect((ip, port))` internally, which our `socket.connect`
  hook then re-checked against the hostname allowlist. The IP isn't
  in the manifest, so every legitimately-declared widget (weather_now,
  clock_sunrise_sunset, anything talking to a real upstream) failed
  with `CapabilityDenied: tried to connect to '188.40.99.226' but
  didn't declare it`. The connect hook now skips the post-DNS call
  via a contextvar set inside the approved `create_connection` path;
  raw `socket.socket().connect()` outside that path is still checked.

## [0.36.1], 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Playwright base image + pip pin re-coupled.** The Dockerfile was
  pinned at `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.49.0-noble` but
  `pyproject.toml` allowed `playwright>=1.42,<2`, so a fresh image
  build resolved Playwright 1.60.0 against a v1.49 Chromium and bombed
  at first render with `Executable doesn't exist at
  /ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1223/...`. Bumped the base
  image to `v1.60.0-noble` and tightened the pip pin to
  `>=1.60,<1.61` so the Chromium revision the Python client expects
  and the one bundled in the image are guaranteed to match. The
  Dockerfile comment already promised this lockstep; now it actually
  is.

## [0.36.0], 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Data import + backup restore no longer refused in the HA add-on /
  Docker image.** `refuse_in_container()` was over-broad: it gated
  four routes (`update/apply`, `update/rollback`,
  `backup/<id>/restore`, `data/import`), but only the first two
  need it (those mutate the code tree via `git pull`). Restore +
  import only write to the persistent `data/` volume, which
  survives container upgrades; the post-restore `os.execv` cleanly
  replaces the container's PID 1 (the entrypoint already `exec`s
  through gosu). Previously, hitting Import in HA Settings →
  System → Backups returned a misleading "use docker compose
  pull" flash instead of importing. Both routes now work in HA,
  Docker, and bare installs alike; self-update remains refused
  under Docker.

## [0.35.2], 2026-06-07

### Changed

- **Marketplace card thumbnails switch to `object-fit: fill`.**
  After two iterations on aspect-ratio (5:3 → 3:2) and
  object-position tuning still left letterboxing on some catalog
  entries, dropped the aspect-ratio math and stretched the image
  to fill the frame. Predictable, no empty space, accepting minor
  distortion as the tradeoff. Cards are thumbnails; contributors'
  source repo link is one click away if a user wants the true
  ratio.

## [0.35.1], 2026-06-07

### Changed

- **Marketplace card thumbnail aspect-ratio 5:3 → 3:2** to match
  the lg widget cell dimensions (1200×800). Tight catalog
  screenshots (taken via element-screenshot of `.cell` rather than
  Playwright `full_page`) now fill the Browse card with no
  letterboxing. Wider/taller sources still crop cleanly via
  `object-fit: cover`; the `object-position` shifted from `center`
  to `top center` so legacy full-page screenshots show the widget
  area instead of dead space below it.
- **All three live catalog entries got fresh tight screenshots**
  (1200×800 each) so the new aspect-ratio doesn't show
  letterboxing on entries that pre-date this change.

## [0.35.0], 2026-06-07

Marketplace phase 2: widget capability manifest + runtime
enforcement. Closes [#2](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/2).

### Added

- **`requires:` block in `plugin.json`.** Widgets declare which
  capabilities they need (network egress targets, settings reads,
  filesystem writes) as a list of `<category>:<value>` strings.
  Vocabulary: `network:<hostname>` (or `network:*` for unrestricted
  but flagged in review), `settings:plugin` / `settings:plugin/<id>`
  / `settings:app`, `filesystem:write:<path>`.
- **Runtime network enforcement.** The host installs a hook over
  `socket.create_connection` + `socket.socket.connect` and gates
  every connect against the active widget's allowlist. A widget
  trying to phone home to an undeclared host raises
  `CapabilityDenied`, which the composer surfaces as a cell-level
  error rather than a render failure. Lower-level socket usage is
  covered too — the hook fires before DNS so hard-coded IPs can't
  dodge the gate either.
- **Backward compatibility.** Widgets without a `requires:` block
  load with no enforcement (legacy behaviour), so the existing
  catalog + bundled widgets keep working unchanged. The catalog
  review checklist now asks contributors to declare for new
  submissions.

### Changed

- **Three bundled widgets ported as worked examples:** `weather_now`
  and `clock_sunrise_sunset` declare `network:api.open-meteo.com`;
  `clock_analog` declares `requires: []` (the explicit "no
  capabilities" form, distinct from missing block which is legacy).
- **Reviewer checklist** in [docs/dev/publishing-a-widget.md](https://dmellok.github.io/tesserae/dev/publishing-a-widget/)
  expanded to require `requires:` declarations in catalog
  submissions + grep the source against the declared set to confirm
  there's no drift.
- **Widget contract** at [docs/widgets.md](https://dmellok.github.io/tesserae/widgets/)
  gains a "Capabilities, `requires:`" section: vocabulary table,
  how enforcement works (contextvar scope + socket hook), backward
  compat, and an honest threat-model section noting Python's
  sandbox-hostility — this catches casual drift, not a determined
  attacker. Real isolation lives in #3.

### Trust model — what this catches

What it catches: a community widget that quietly tries to POST your
MQTT password to some upstream gets a `CapabilityDenied` and the
deny lands in the server log. The "reviewer reads the manifest +
greps the code" workflow becomes load-bearing — the manifest is a
machine-checked claim.

What it doesn't catch: a widget reaching around with `ctypes`,
frame inspection, or a subprocess. The hook is defence-in-depth on
top of the audit-only PR review, not a substitute for it.
Capability declarations PLUS the PR review is the trust model;
full isolation is [#3](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/issues/3).

### Internals

- `app/capabilities.py` (new): `Capabilities` dataclass + `parse()`
  + `capability_scope()` contextmanager + idempotent
  `install()` / `uninstall()` socket hooks. ContextVar-backed so
  concurrent renders don't cross-contaminate.
- `app/plugin_loader.py`: parses `requires:` during discovery and
  stores the snapshot on `Plugin.capabilities`. Malformed entries
  log + drop rather than failing the load.
- `app/composer.py`: `_fetch_plugin_data` enters
  `capability_scope(plugin.capabilities)` around the widget's
  `fetch()` call.
- `app/app_factory.py`: installs hooks once after the registry is
  built. Idempotent so the dev reloader doesn't stack hooks.
- 19 new tests covering parse / scope nesting / urllib enforcement /
  legacy bypass / install idempotence. 853 tests pass total.

## [0.34.2], 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Topbar battery indicator.** When any registered device instance
  is reporting a `battery_pct` heartbeat, a small Phosphor battery
  glyph appears next to the theme toggle. Single-device installs
  show the percentage inline; multi-device installs show a count
  badge with a hover/click popover listing every battery + level.
  The trigger paints in the tone of the worst battery
  (critical ≤10% / low ≤30% / ok) so a single critical device
  catches the eye when others are fine. Mains-powered devices
  (Pi paths) don't surface here, so a panel-only deployment stays
  uncluttered.

### Changed

- **Low-battery push overlay.** Dropped the black border (was picking
  up dither artifacts on some panel gamuts) and re-anchored the
  Phosphor glyph to share a baseline with the percentage text so
  they read as "on the same line" instead of the icon visibly
  floating above the digits.

## [0.34.1], 2026-06-07

### Changed

- **Rename Plugins → Widgets in the UI + docs.** Top-nav dropdown
  label, the "All plugins" link, the `/plugins/` page title + h1,
  the Settings tab + blurb, and every "Settings → Plugins"
  breadcrumb in the docs all now say "Widgets". The
  Plugin-development wiki section becomes Widget development;
  `docs/dev/writing-a-plugin.md` is renamed to `writing-a-widget.md`.
  Code paths (`plugin_loader`, `/plugins/` URLs, the `plugins/`
  directory, `plugin.json`, `plugin.schema.json`) are unchanged —
  those are the technical contract and renaming them would break
  every installed widget.

## [0.34.0], 2026-06-07

Marketplace bundle support for widget families.

### Added

- **Catalog bundles.** A catalog entry can now install a whole
  widget family (e.g. github_core + github_releases +
  github_actions) in one click. The tarball wraps every subplugin in
  a single containing folder, and the marketplace install path
  auto-detects the layout. Optional `folders: [...]` field on the
  entry declares the expected subfolders; when present, the install
  verifies the tarball matches exactly and the Browse card lists
  every folder so users see what's about to land.
- **Browse card bundle line.** Cards now show "Bundle, installs N
  plugin folders: foo_core, foo_widget" when the entry installs
  more than one folder, so the install action is unambiguous.

### Changed

- **`InstalledRecord` now carries a `folders` list** instead of a
  single `plugin_id`. Existing single-widget records (pre-0.34) read
  back as `folders=[catalog_id]` via a backward-compat shim in
  `from_json`, so v0.33 installs survive the upgrade untouched.
- **Marketplace uninstall is keyed by `catalog_id`** (the form field
  on the Browse uninstall button renamed from `plugin_id` to
  `catalog_id`). For bundle entries the uninstall removes every
  folder the install record lists, plus optionally each folder's
  data dir under `data/plugins/`.
- **Catalog CI workflow** (in the seed at
  `docs/marketplace-catalog-seed/`) now extracts each tarball and
  cross-checks the declared `folders` against the actual subfolders.
  Mismatched submissions die at the PR gate.

### Internals

- `app/marketplace.py` gains `_detect_layout`: unwraps the
  GitHub-style single-folder envelope, then returns either
  `{entry.id: <single folder>}` (single widget) or
  `{child_id: <child path>, ...}` (bundle). Tarball extraction still
  uses `tarfile.data_filter` (PEP 706) so path-traversal + suid
  attacks die at the gate.
- Per-folder install moves are now atomic-ish across the bundle: a
  mid-move OS error rolls back every backup + drops any
  partially-installed sibling, so a half-installed bundle can't
  leak onto disk.
- Embedded `kind` + `version` cross-checks are skipped for bundles
  because each subfolder has its own kind + version independently;
  the sha256 verify catches tarball drift regardless.
- 9 new test cases for bundles: happy path, auto-detect without
  declared folders, declared-vs-actual mismatch, subfolder without
  plugin.json, collision on one subfolder aborts atomically,
  uninstall removes every folder, uninstall with delete_data clears
  each data dir, reinstall replaces in-place, and a legacy-record
  backward-compat read.

## [0.33.0], 2026-06-07

Community widget marketplace, phase 1 (audit-only catalog).

### Added

- **Settings → Plugins → Browse community widgets.** A new Browse
  page (also reachable from the Plugins nav dropdown) shows a card
  grid of community-contributed widgets, each with a screenshot,
  description, author, tags, and an Install button. Behind the scenes
  the host fetches a static `widgets.json` index from a configurable
  catalog URL (default
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/dmellok/tesserae-widgets/main/widgets.json`),
  validates it against the new `schema/marketplace.schema.json`, and
  on install: downloads the pinned release tarball, verifies the
  declared sha256, validates the embedded `plugin.json` against
  `schema/plugin.schema.json`, and drops the result into
  `plugins/<id>/` alongside the bundled widgets.
- **Update + Uninstall flows.** Browse shows "Update available" when
  the catalog's `release.version` exceeds the installed one;
  Uninstall refuses to touch any plugin not tracked in
  `data/core/marketplace.json` (so bundled plugins are safe even
  against a hand-crafted POST), with an optional tick to also drop
  the plugin's data dir.
- **Restart-required banner + button.** Install / uninstall flash a
  "Restart Tesserae to load it" notice and add a one-click button
  that hits the existing updater re-exec path. Live re-discovery of
  the plugin registry would need blueprint deregistration + safe
  `importlib.reload` which Flask doesn't support cleanly, so v1
  treats every marketplace mutation as restart-to-pick-up.
- **`marketplace_index_url` setting** (Settings → Server → App). Point
  at a fork or empty the field to disable the Browse page entirely.
- **Catalog repo seed** at `docs/marketplace-catalog-seed/`. A
  copy-into-a-new-repo scaffold for `dmellok/tesserae-widgets`:
  empty `widgets.json`, a copy of the host's index schema,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` (PR review checklist + submission flow), a PR
  template, and a GitHub Actions workflow that validates the index
  + fetches every tarball + verifies sha256 + checks screenshot
  PNGs exist before any PR can merge.

### Trust model (audit-only, phase 1)

Every catalog entry is a PR reviewed by the catalog maintainer. There
is no capability sandbox or process isolation in this phase — see
GitHub issues #2 and #3 for the follow-up work those represent.
Audit-only is fine while every entry passes through human review; it
does not scale to "anyone can publish without review", which is
gated behind those two issues.

### Internals

- `app/marketplace.py` — `Marketplace` orchestrator with `fetch_index`,
  `install`, `uninstall`, and a 5-minute in-memory index cache.
  Tarball extraction uses `tarfile.data_filter` (PEP 706) so path
  traversal + suid attacks die at extract time; downloads cap at
  4 MiB.
- `app/marketplace_routes.py` — Browse / install / uninstall / restart
  endpoints mounted at `/plugins/browse*` (alongside the existing
  plugin admin routes, but on a separate blueprint).
- `tests/test_marketplace.py` — 18 cases covering index fetch failure
  modes, install rejections (bundled collision, compat mismatch,
  sha256 mismatch, oversize tarball, missing manifest, kind
  mismatch), happy path, upgrade-in-place, uninstall safety net,
  data-dir preservation by default, corrupt-state recovery.

## [0.32.1], 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- CI mypy --strict failure on `app/push.py`: the `_ui_font` helper
  reassigned `font` from a `FreeTypeFont` to the base `ImageFont`
  type on the bitmap-default fallback path, which is incompatible
  under strict typing. Annotated as `Any` to match the function's
  return type.

## [0.32.0], 2026-06-07

Polish pass on Send + low-battery overlay for battery-powered devices.

### Added

- **Low-battery overlay on device pushes** (Settings → Server → App).
  When a device with a battery reports a charge at or below the
  threshold (default 15%, configurable 5-50%), a small white-on-black
  chip with a Phosphor `battery-warning` glyph + percent label paints
  in the top-right of the composition before the per-renderer
  transform. So the warning survives dithering / quantization and
  reaches the panel as drawn. Per-renderer (each device's last-known
  battery decides whether its push wears the chip), so a fan-out to a
  mains-powered Pi + a low TRMNL only marks the TRMNL. Toggle off
  entirely under Settings → Server → App.
- **Phosphor regular TTF vendored** at
  `static/icons/phosphor/regular/Phosphor.ttf`. Server-side image
  rendering (currently the low-battery overlay) needs the icon font
  on disk because PIL can't read the woff2 web font. Loaded lazily +
  cached by pixel size.

### Changed

- **Send page live preview now follows the picked target device.**
  Ticking a device on File / URL / Webpage / Gallery reshapes the
  preview frame to that device's panel aspect (e.g. 800×480 landscape
  vs 1200×1600 portrait). Previously the preview was pinned to the
  global virtual panel preset, so fit-mode previews on a non-default
  target were misleading. Falls back to the virtual panel when no
  device is ticked.
- **Removed the Saved-dashboard tab from Send.** Pushing a saved
  dashboard already lives on the Dashboards page (per-row Send
  button) and inside the editor (Push-now). Send is now arbitrary-
  input only: File / URL / Webpage / Gallery.

### Fixed

- **White flash on every page navigation in dark mode.** External
  CSS was responsible for the body bg, so the canvas painted white
  for a frame while base.css was in flight. An inline `<style>` in
  `<head>` now sets the `html` element's background + `color-scheme`
  to match the saved theme, so the canvas paints the right colour
  before any external CSS arrives.

## [0.31.0], 2026-06-06

Whole-catalogue widget visual pass (59 widgets, every family) plus an
admin-UI refresh on top, vivid light themes, a Glances instance
registry, history page filtering, and a slate of mobile polish.

### Widget visual pass — every family

Family-by-family visual pass that landed across v0.30.0-v0.30.3 and is
now formally cut. Every bundled widget got the same treatment: turn
paragraphs of numbers into visual anchors that scale cleanly across
cell sizes (xs/sm/md/lg).

- **Calendar** (`calendar_day`, `calendar_week`, `calendar_month`):
  time-of-day icons in the day gutter, event-density strips, weekend
  column tints, today-marker chips, per-feed micro-strips, heat-tint
  backgrounds, UTC → local TZ fixes. `calendar_week` server forwards
  event end times so multi-hour events span properly.
- **Clocks** (`clock_analog`, `clock_qlock`, `clock_sunrise_sunset`,
  `clock_word`, `clock_world`): five analog face styles + AM/PM sun
  indicator + date plate + roman/arabic/dots numerals; QLOCK gets
  vignette + paper-texture backgrounds; sun-arc widget gains twilight
  bands, golden-hour tints, full sun-path arc; word clock gets phase
  badges; world clock adds five-phase sun glyphs + 24-hour day/night
  strip per city.
- **GitHub** (6 widgets): per-workflow-type icons + 8-bar timeline +
  duration sparkline; stacked-by-type 7-day histogram with dominant-
  type glyph in each bar; paired streak hero chips + 12-month summary
  bars; PR-age tier chips + draft/ready icons + comment bubbles;
  SemVer bump pill + commits-since-release tail; top-contributors
  strip with avatars.
- **Home Assistant** (12 widgets): per-device-type lead glyph + SVG
  battery with fill bar + CRITICAL/LOW pills (ha_battery); corner
  timestamp + multi-camera grid (ha_camera); radial thermostat dial
  with grid for multi-entity (ha_climate); Chart.js Sankey for power
  flow with sun-position glyph + comparison sparkline (ha_energy);
  expanded device-class glyph table + recent-change wash + timer
  badge (ha_entities); threshold line + min/max markers + hourly-
  profile ghost overlay (ha_history); per-light brightness mini-bar
  tinted by colour + kelvin/RGB swatch (ha_lights); stateful kind
  glyphs + unsecured-since timer (ha_locks); blurred album-art bleed
  + track-deterministic waveform glyph (ha_media); expanded device-
  class glyphs + 24h trend arrow + inline sparkline (ha_sensor);
  due-date proximity colour chips + iCal priority dot + OVERDUE
  title bar (ha_todo); coloured-initials avatar fallback + zone-name
  glyph (ha_zones).
- **News** (4): story-type chips + score-strength bars (HN); post-
  type lead glyph + subreddit-coloured stripe (Reddit); source-host
  chip with initial (RSS); era glyph + thumbnail + HTML/CSS year-
  timeline strip (Wikipedia OTD).
- **Sky** (3 of 4, plus `sky_bom_warnings` from the weather pass):
  radar dial with bearing+distance plotting per flight + altitude
  bar + bolder rings (`sky_air_traffic`); half-circle Kp gauge with
  banded segments + needle (`sky_aurora`); progress ring around the
  moon disc + craters clipped to lit side + next-phase chip
  (`sky_moon`).
- **Finance** (3): up/down delta pills (crypto); country flag pair
  in title + Chart.js sparkline with 7-day rolling-average overlay
  (currency); day-range track with current-price pip (stock).
- **Spotify** (2): track-deterministic SVG waveform glyph under the
  progress bar (`spotify_now_playing`); circular progress ring around
  now-playing thumbnail + per-track duration mini-bar
  (`spotify_queue`).
- **Public transport** (`public_transport_times`): route-number
  colour chip + countdown ring around the next-departure glyph.
- **Other** (`glances_status`, `octoprint_status`, `todo`): per-metric
  ring gauges + load/uptime footer (glances); radial print-completion
  ring + percent centre (octoprint); completion progress bar at top
  of list (todo).

### Chart helpers

- `static/spectra-chart.js`: added `sankey()` helper backed by the
  vendored `chartjs-chart-sankey` UMD; `lineChart()` gained
  `threshold` / `markers` / `overlay` params for ha_history's
  threshold line + min/max marker dots + hourly-profile ghost;
  `sparkline()` gained an `overlay` param for finance_currency's
  rolling-average dashed line.
- `static/vendor/chartjs-chart-sankey.min.js` (10 KB UMD) loaded in
  `templates/compose.html` so the Sankey controller registers
  globally.

### Glances Core (new plugin)

- New **glances_core** data plugin with an admin page at
  `/plugins/glances_core/` that persists a list of Glances server
  instances (name + URL) to its `data_dir/instances.json`. Exposes
  `get_instance(id)` + `list_instances()` + `choices(name)`.
- `glances_status` cell now offers a dropdown that picks from saved
  instances; falls back to an inline URL for cells configured before
  the instance registry existed.
- Admin page restyled to match the schedules/themes admin vocabulary
  (`<section class="card">` + `card_head` macro + `.form` + `.field-
  grid` + `.button.primary`).

### Vivid light themes

- Three new bundled light themes with greater bg → surface contrast +
  more saturated accents than the default Light: `vivid-light` (warm
  stone canvas, ~22% L* delta), `citrus-light` (cream canvas, candy-
  bright accents), `arctic-light` (cool steel-blue canvas, jewel-tone
  accents). All three pass the theme-registry guard test.

### History page

- `/history` gained a chip-based source filter that scopes the log to
  one trigger (scheduler / webhook / page / Home Assistant / etc.).
  Chips use the same `.event-type-filter .chip` vocabulary as
  `/events/` so the two pages feel like the same product. Per-source
  count badges, with the active chip inverting to the accent. New
  `EventLog.list(source=)` + `EventLog.source_counts()` powers it.
- Scheduler row chip + nav icon swapped from `ph-clock-clockwise` to
  `ph-calendar-dots` (was too easily confused with History's
  `ph-clock-counter-clockwise`).
- Top-nav order: History moved after Schedules so the destructive +
  read-only views aren't adjacent.

### Mobile zoom lock

- New `mobile_zoom_lock` switch under Settings → Server → App
  (default ON). When ON, the viewport meta pins `maximum-scale=1,
  user-scalable=no` and a small JS gesture blocker catches iOS
  Safari's `gesturestart` events (which deliberately ignore the
  meta). `touch-action: manipulation` on html/body kills double-tap-
  to-zoom across all mobile browsers. Turn OFF to restore the
  browser zoom layer for accessibility.
- `app_settings` now forwarded to every template via
  `app_factory.py`'s context processor.

### Em-dash sweep

- Replaced every em-dash (U+2014) across the repo with the standard
  prose substitutes (3179 replacements across 431 files): `" — "` →
  `, `; bare `—` → `-`. Aligns with the project's "no em-dashes in
  prose" guideline. Doesn't touch en-dashes (U+2013), still used for
  numeric ranges.

### Glances ring sizing + picture chip cleanup

- `glances_status` 0.2.3: ring row claims flex space; rings scale
  with cell up to 14em; redundant CPU hero number dropped in favour
  of the rings.
- Picture widgets (`picture_apod`, `picture_apple_album`,
  `picture_gallery`, `picture_unsplash`): removed the day-badge /
  sequence pill / folder + count chips / credit-avatar chip after
  user feedback that they didn't render well. Original captions
  retained where they existed.

### Docs

- Gallery PNGs recaptured at `lg` (1200×800) for the docs site, so
  every widget card in `docs/widgets/gallery.md` shows the new
  visuals at full-detail size. Generated via
  `scripts/capture_widget_shots.py SIZE=lg`.

### F1 family visual pass

Continued the widget visual pass through the four F1 widgets. Same goal as
the weather pass: turn paragraphs of numbers into real visual anchors that
adapt cleanly across cell sizes.

- **f1_last_race** (0.1.0 → 0.1.4). Replaced the 3-cell status-grid podium
  with team-coloured podium steps in P2-P1-P3 visual order (P1 tallest,
  centre). Each block tinted by constructor livery (Ferrari red, Mercedes
  teal, Red Bull navy, etc.) using a small inline hex map keyed by
  Jolpica's `constructorId`. Trophy glyph hangs above the winner's code;
  plum lightning above whichever driver set the fastest lap (`data.podium[i].fastest`).
  Meta line (circuit · locality · country) progressively sheds bits as the
  cell narrows so it doesn't clip at the bottom. Circuit silhouette lives on
  the right column only at LG; SVG sized to `100% × 100%` with the
  `preserveAspectRatio` from f1_core's `trackSvg` doing the letterboxing.
- **f1_next** (0.1.0 → 0.1.3). Country flag emoji in the title (Canada →
  🇨🇦, Bahrain → 🇧🇭, etc.), every host on the current calendar plus a
  few historical venues mapped. Six session mini-cards (FP1 / FP2 / FP3 /
  Sprint / Quali / **Race**) replace the status-grid; the Race card was
  previously missing entirely. Each card has icon + label + `Sat 14` date
  + `14:00` time, accent-bordered and `color-mix`-soft-tinted by session
  type (practice = muted, sprint/quali = ochre, race = terracotta). Hero
  countdown gets `--accent-1` weight and a `ph-clock-countdown` glyph.
  Schedule is 3 columns × 2 rows at LG so "QUALI" no longer clips to
  "QUA", and adaptive height/width queries handle short MD cells.
- **f1_standings_drivers** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1). `server.py` now fetches the
  previous round's standings (`/current/{round-1}/driverStandings.json`)
  and computes a per-driver `delta` field so the client can render
  position-change chips (`↑3` accent-3, `↓1` accent-1, `-` muted,
  omitted when no previous-round data). Points-gap micro-bar under each
  row scales to `points / leader_points`, filled in the driver's team
  livery colour. Crown glyph (`ph-crown`) marks the championship leader
  to keep `ph-trophy` reserved for race wins in f1_last_race.
- **f1_weekend** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1). Sessions cluster under
  `FRIDAY · 14 MAR` / `SATURDAY · 15 MAR` / `SUNDAY · 16 MAR` day
  headers so the weekend's shape reads in one scan. Race row gets a soft
  accent-1 tinted background + accent-1 left border + black weight so
  "RACE at 13:00" always pops. Country flag in title matches f1_next.

### Color emoji rendering

- **`Dockerfile`**: added `fonts-noto-color-emoji` to the apt install
  alongside `gosu` (~12 MB on top of the existing image). Without it,
  country flag emoji in widgets fall back to regional-indicator letter
  pairs in boxes on Linux. macOS dev hosts use Apple Color Emoji so this
  bug wouldn't have surfaced in local preview.

### Weather widget visual pass

Family-by-family enhancement of every weather widget (plus `sky_bom_warnings`,
which is conceptually weather even though it lives under `sky_*`). Goal: give
each widget a real visual anchor instead of paragraphs of numbers, and make
the layout adapt cleanly across xs / sm / md / lg cells.

- **weather_now** (0.1.5 → 0.1.8). LG is now a 2-column grid, hero +
  4-metric strip on the left, full-height sunrise/sunset arc strip on the
  right (was a thin band crammed under the metrics). MD-tall (height ≥ 600)
  shows the arc band below the metrics; MD-tight (height ≤ 449) drops the
  metric labels and tightens the icon+value stack to fit without clipping.
- **weather_forecast** (0.1.1 → 0.1.5). Replaced the horizontal day strip
  with a vertical day stack: `[Day] [Icon] [Lo ─── Hi] [Rain%]` per row,
  today's row tinted with `--surface-sunken` and the day label flipped to
  `--accent-4`. LG cells get a side-by-side layout with a Chart.js filled
  `lineChart` of the daily highs in terracotta (`--accent-1`). Rain droplet
  icon repositioned to the right of the percentage so every row's icon
  column lines up.
- **weather_hourly** (0.2.0 → 0.2.2). Single-colour temperature line
  replaced with a mixed bar+line chart: rain probability bars on a right
  y-axis (teal), temperature line with a vertical warm-to-cool gradient
  (accent-1 → accent-2 → accent-5). Custom Chart.js plugin shades night
  hours (18-06) with a translucent text-primary tint, clamped to the
  chart area so the bands don't spill past the final tick. Hour count
  culls by cell width (24 lg / 18 md / 12 sm / 6 xs); axis tick font
  auto-scales 10–20px so wide cells paint legible numbers.
- **weather_air_quality** (0.1.1 → 0.1.3). Hero replaced with a
  half-circle gauge, 6 EAQI band segments (moss → teal → ochre →
  terracotta → plum → red) with a marker pip at the current value;
  number reads inside the arc, band label below. Per-pollutant grid
  cells gain a micro-bar showing `value / band_max`, tinted by the
  pollutant's own band. Cells participate in the grid via subgrid so
  every row's label / value / bar tracks stay synchronised, a wrapped
  "4.2 μg/m³" no longer drops one bar below its neighbours.
- **weather_pollen_count** (0.1.1 → 0.1.7). 4-step severity bar per tile
  (Low / Moderate / High / Very High). Icons scale by severity
  (0.75× / 1.0× / 1.25× / 1.5×) so a Very High weed tile visibly dwarfs
  a Low grass tile. No-data tiles collapse the value + bar + level word
  triplet into a single centred `ph-minus-circle`. Empty bar segments
  use a `color-mix` translucent overlay so they read against the soft-
  tinted backgrounds where `--surface-sunken` was invisible. Plus a bug
  fix: `item.level` from the server was a 0-100 percent being used as a
  string key, falling through to muted-grey on every tile.
- **weather_wind** (0.1.1 → 0.1.3). Compass rose now grows 8 teal petals
  sized by the server's 24h speed-weighted directional histogram
  (`data.rose`); current-direction needle (ochre) overlays as an outline
  so the petals stay visible underneath. Beaufort chip
  (`B7 NEAR GALE`-style) replaces the text-only Beaufort label, with the
  background tinted by severity (accent-3 → -2 → -1 → -6 by bucket). LG
  cells get a 12-hour filled gust sparkline below the main row.
- **sky_bom_warnings** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1). Vertical severity colour-band
  down the left of each row (`accent-1 / -3 / -5` by severity). Tag is
  now a proper severity-tinted chip; region (state code) + time-since-
  issued chip in the row meta. Rows sort worst-first
  (red → yellow → blue, then phase, then original order). The
  no-warnings empty state replaced with a moss-tinted card carrying a
  chunky `ph-shield-check` so "all clear" reads as confident
  reassurance instead of blank space.

### Widget preview rebuild

- The dev `/_test/preview` page is now a **single composed page** in one
  iframe instead of four separate cards. Cells lay out as a recursive
  halving spiral, cell 1 takes half the panel, cell 2 takes half the
  remainder, etc., so the same widget paints at LG → MD → MD → SM →
  SM → XS → XS-unassigned in a single render at panel native dimensions.
- **Panel-size dropdown** drives the synthetic page's dimensions (Inky
  / Waveshare presets), so the same widget can be eyeballed at every
  Tesserae-supported panel without composing a real page.
- Cell tags in preview mode now include the **size bucket** alongside
  the cell index and plugin id (e.g. `1 · LG · weather_now`), matching
  the bucket the widget's own container queries fire against.

### History page + per-trigger source chips

- **History moved to a top-level nav entry** (`/history`). Previously
  the push log was a tab buried inside Send; now it's one click from
  anywhere. Send loses its History tab; the four remaining tabs
  (File / Saved / URL / Webpage) still redirect to the new History
  page after a push, so the "I just pushed, where's the result?"
  flow stays muscle-memory.
- **Per-trigger chips on every history row**. Pushes now carry a
  `source` value through the whole pipeline so each row shows what
  kicked it off: **Send page** (paper plane, teal), **Schedule**
  (clock, ochre), **Webhook** (arrow-in, terracotta), **Home
  Assistant** (house, slate). The trigger was already in the event
  log but every page-push was getting logged as `page` regardless of
  caller; `PushManager.push()` now takes a `source=` kwarg and the
  scheduler / webhook / HA call sites pass the right value.

### Dev widget preview page

- **New `/_test/preview` page** (Dev nav → Widget preview). One
  widget rendered at every supported size (xs / sm / md / lg) in a
  single grid, with a left rail for the controls: widget picker,
  theme picker, style picker, sample-data toggle, and a form-builder
  generated from the plugin's `cell_options` schema. Useful when
  iterating on a widget's layout, you can tweak a place label or
  unit and see all four sizes reflow without composing a dashboard
  first. Dev-only, gated behind `debug or testing` like the rest of
  `/_test/`.
- The underlying `/_test/render` endpoint now accepts `?opts=<json>`
  so the preview page can inject cell options through the existing
  composer pipeline.

### Weather widget polish

- **weather_now sizing pass**. Content-adaptive at xs (hero-only,
  vertical stack), sm (two metrics, no labels), md (unchanged), lg
  (hero icon + temp grow to fill, new sunrise/sunset arc band shows
  the sun's current position between rise and set). Fixes the
  "feels empty at lg, cramped at sm" complaint from the visual pass.

## [0.29.0], 2026-06-05

Theme system rebuilt end-to-end, calibrated dither path landed,
admin password management filled in, plus a long tail of editor /
device-pipeline polish. Eighty-eight commits aggregated since
v0.16.26; the intermediate tags v0.16.27 through v0.28.2 carry the
incremental history.

### Themes, the headline rebuild

- **Spectra design system**, orthogonal `data-theme` × `data-style`
  axes, set on `<body>` and overridable per cell. Theme controls
  colour only; style controls typography / spacing / shape, never
  colour. Any of the 19 bundled themes composes with any of the 9
  bundled styles.
- **19 bundled themes** across four families: Light
  (light / sepia / cool-gray / high-contrast), Dark (dark / nord),
  Movement (bauhaus / destijl / brutalist palettes), and base16 (10
  popular code-editor palettes: Gruvbox, Solarized, Dracula,
  Catppuccin Mocha, Monokai, Tomorrow, One Dark).
- **Themes page** at top-nav → Themes, a vertical strip of every
  theme on the left, the builder pane in the middle, and a sticky
  preview on the right. Click any theme to load it; bundled themes
  show a "Duplicate to edit" CTA, user themes are editable +
  deletable.
- **Theme builder**: 20 colour tokens (3 surfaces + 4 text + 1 edge
  + 6 accents × 2 (base + soft) + 1 on-accent), plus mode
  (light/dark) and an optional font-family. Live preview tracks
  every input via inline CSS-variable overrides on the preview pane.
- **Image-to-theme**, upload a photo or poster, k-means picks
  dominant colours, the assignment heuristic spreads them across the
  Spectra tokens (light/dark mode auto-detected from the modal
  cluster's luminance). One click fills the form. Calibration data
  ported from
  [paperlesspaper/epdoptimize](https://github.com/paperlesspaper/epdoptimize)
  (Apache 2.0).
- **Auto-derive soft tints switch**, when on, every
  `accent_N_soft` becomes a mix of its accent with the page
  background, recomputed live as either edits. Persists on the
  user theme.
- **User-saved themes** at `data/themes/user.json` (no longer under
  `data/plugins/themes_core/`, since the themes_core plugin is gone).
  Served as a single `[data-theme="user-<slug>"]` stylesheet from
  `/themes/user.css`; loaded alongside the bundled Spectra cascade
  on every composed page.
- **Bundled-colour parsing**, the builder lifts each bundled
  theme's actual `bg / surface / accent-*` values straight from the
  Spectra CSS at import time, so duplicating Nord (or any other
  bundled theme) produces a copy carrying that theme's real colours
  instead of the Light defaults.

### Quantizer / colour pipeline

- **Opt-in calibrated palette + tone mapping**, per-device toggle on
  the `esp32_bin` and `pi_bin` renderers. Dithers Floyd-Steinberg
  against the panel's measured Spectra 6 / ACeP colours instead of
  nominal sRGB primaries, and runs a linear tone-map pre-pass that
  squeezes the source range into the calibrated black/white band so
  the dither has room to spread error. Calibration data ported from
  paperlesspaper/epdoptimize.
- **Eight dither modes** for the `.bin` packers: Floyd-Steinberg,
  none, Atkinson, Jarvis-Judice-Ninke, Stucki, Bayer-8x8, halftone,
  crosshatch.
- **Firmware-native panel orientation** auto-detected from the
  panel preset (`PanelPreset.native_landscape`); the renderer packs
  at the firmware's actual row stride regardless of how the user
  mounts the panel.
- **Pre-v0.20 ESP32 manifest backfill**, startup migration adds
  `native_w` / `native_h` to existing `esp32_client` instance
  manifests so legacy installs don't paint at the wrong stride.

### Authentication & admin ops

- **Change / disable / re-enable password** from Settings → System
  → Authentication. When disabled, the gate still 403s public IPs
  and only lets LAN traffic through.
- **`tesserae --reset-password`** CLI escape hatch for when the
  password is lost.
- **Firmware splash PNGs** at nine common sizes
  (64 / 96 / 128 / 192 / 256 / 384 / 512 / 768 / 1024) under
  `static/brand/firmware/` for client builders.
- **Dev dropdown** in the top-nav (under `--dev`) grouping the
  Widget gallery + Theme × style matrix.

### Editor / UI polish

- **Reactive editor**: floating back-to-top FAB on the small-viewport
  layout. Drag along the bottom edge to flip the FAB to the other
  side; the side preference persists in localStorage.
- **Composer remounts cells** whenever theme / style / font flips so
  the new cascade actually paints instead of inheriting stale
  variables.
- **Multiselect search box actually filters now** (composer regression).
- **Single-card palette** in the theme builder, surfaces, text, and
  the six accent pairs collapsed into one card with sub-group
  headings.
- **F1 widget pass**: track outline moved + bolder stroke, backing
  card behind the track, team-colour stripe on standings rows, more
  Phosphor icons across the family.
- **Weather suite visual punch**: shaded line chart in `weather_hourly`
  (12h default), hero icon scaling in `weather_now`, AQI scale in
  `weather_air_quality`, compass rose in `weather_wind`, tile cards
  in `weather_pollen_count`.

### Bug fixes

- `Device.panel` now propagates `native_w` / `native_h` through to
  the renderer (regression fixed the office Waveshare 13.3"
  appearing distorted).
- `push.py`'s `_panel_dims_for_send` builds the dict via
  `device_panel(device)` instead of hand-rolling, so native dims
  ride through.
- esp32_bin renderer packs at firmware-native dims, not the
  calibration choice.
- `ha_camera` unwraps `items[0]` from the server-side wrapper;
  full-bleed mode added.
- `weather_now` hero icon resizes via `cqmin` + container query so
  it doesn't clip text at high zoom levels.
- `sky_moon` row layout at medium widths + hard-coded moon colours
  so dark themes don't desaturate the disc.
- Chart self-referencing `--font-family` variable broke cell inline
  styles; fixed.

### Docs

- README + wiki refreshed against current state (widget count,
  theme tally, palette token count, removed-feature scrub).
- `dev/writing-a-plugin.md` refreshed for Spectra, drops the dead
  `--c-*` / `--theme-*` / variant-cell-option doctrine; replaces
  with the semantic-token list, the `data-style` axis, and the
  seven body archetypes.
- New `NOTICES.md` crediting paperlesspaper/epdoptimize for the
  calibration palette data (Apache 2.0).

### Quality

- **779 tests** passing (pytest), up from ~600.
- `mypy --strict` module list extended to include `themes_routes`.
- New guard test ensures the Spectra CSS `[data-theme="..."]` blocks
  and the Python theme registry never drift.

### Removed (since v0.16.26)

- Pre-v0.16.27 widget `--c-bg` / `--c-fg` / `--c-accent` /
  `--c-data-*` / `--c-ok/warn/danger` token cascade.
  The Spectra rebuild paints widgets from `--bg`, `--surface`,
  `--text-primary`, `--accent-1..6`, etc. directly. `--c-zoom`
  survived as the cell-content-zoom variable.
- `variant` cell option from widget manifests. The orthogonal
  `data-theme` × `data-style` axes mean one widget composes with
  every (theme, style) pair instead of shipping N visual directions.
- `plugins/themes_core/` plugin, themes now live in
  `static/style/spectra-*.css` + a Python registry, not the plugin
  tree.
- `scripts/capture_widget_variants.py`, the per-widget variant
  composite generator. `scripts/capture_widget_shots.py` still
  refreshes the gallery hero shot; cross-theme / cross-style
  comparison lives at `/_test/matrix`.

## [0.16.10], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **The "bare install" upgrade hint in Settings → System no longer
  suggests `pip install --upgrade tesserae`**, Tesserae isn't on
  PyPI yet, so that command does nothing useful. Replaced with the
  canonical install path (the `install.sh` curl one-liner, or a
  manual `git clone` + `pip install -e ".[dev]"`) and a note that
  the in-app pull-and-restart flow specifically needs a git
  checkout as the source dir. Canonical installs (which keep `.git`
  via install.sh's `git clone` + editable pip install) are
  unchanged, they still see the full Check / Apply / Rollback UI.

## [0.16.9], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Version-metadata hotfix for v0.16.8.** A parallel-edit race in the
  v0.16.8 commit landed without bumping `pyproject.toml` or
  `plugins/ha_sensor/plugin.json`, so the v0.16.8 tag points at a
  commit where the on-disk files still say `0.16.7` / `0.3.0`. This
  release bumps both to the correct values; functionally identical
  to v0.16.8.

## [0.16.8], 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Per-entity name + icon overrides on `ha_sensor` and `ha_entities`.**
  New `overrides` textarea on each widget's cell-options form lets you
  rename and reicon any entity in the picker without renaming it in
  Home Assistant. Format is one entity per line:
  `entity_id | name | icon`, either name or icon can be left empty
  to keep the auto value (HA's friendly_name and the device-class /
  domain icon respectively). Icon is a Phosphor name (see
  phosphoricons.com) without the `ph-` prefix. Lines starting with
  `#` are comments.

  Example:
  ```
  sensor.living_room_temperature | Living Room | thermometer-simple
  sensor.bedroom_temperature | Bedroom |
  sensor.solar_power | | sun
  ```

  Both widget plugins bumped to 0.4.0 to reflect the new manifest
  field. Existing saved dashboards continue to work, the default is
  empty and falls through to auto.

## [0.16.7], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Settings → System no longer flashes "Update state unavailable:
  not a git repository" on installs without a `.git` directory.** The
  in-app updater shells out to `git` for state / check / apply /
  rollback, which works for `git clone`-based installs but fails for
  pip wheels, unpacked release tarballs, or any other install method
  that doesn't carry git history. New `Updater.has_git_repo()` lets
  the Settings → System controller route those installs through the
  same GitHub release-API view it already used for Docker installs;
  the template gained a third-arm message ("upgrade via your install
  method, `pip install --upgrade tesserae` for venv installs,
  re-download the tarball otherwise") for the bare case. Docker
  installs and git checkouts are unchanged.

## [0.16.6], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Pushing from the dashboards list or the editor no longer yanks
  you to Send → History.** The send_page endpoint was hard-redirecting
  to `/send?tab=history` regardless of where the user came from, which
  was helpful when initiating a push from the Send page itself but
  jarring when the user was triaging dashboards or actively editing a
  page. Forms on `/pages` and `/pages/<id>` now post a hidden
  `return_to` field (`dashboards` / `editor`) the route honours via a
  safelist, the Send-page Saved tab and any other caller without a
  `return_to` keep the legacy redirect-to-History behaviour. Flash
  message also shortened when the user isn't about to see the History
  tab (no point telling them to watch a tab they're not on).

## [0.16.5], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Layout editor: every cell is now resizable, even when its
  neighbours don't share a full edge.** The previous shared-edge
  detection required exact y-range / x-range alignment across the
  full edge length, so as soon as one row's cells were resized to
  a different width than the row above or below, the cells with
  the misaligned edge lost their resize handles entirely. Replaced
  `findSharedEdges` with per-cell edge handles that detect aligned
  neighbours at pointerdown via exact perpendicular-range matching
 , aligned grid cases still resize the matched pair together
  (e.g. dragging a column edge that spans one row affects both
  cells in that row), but cells whose neighbours don't line up
  resize independently into the void (gap or overlap allowed).
  Dedup by edge-position key so shared edges aren't double-rendered
  in the aligned case.

## [0.16.4], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Layout editor resize handles work per-row instead of per-column.**
  In a multi-row layout where a vertical edge spanned multiple rows
  (e.g. 2×2 grid), dragging that edge resized the cells in **every**
  row, not just the row the user clicked in. The fix: at pointerdown,
  filter `edge.left` / `edge.right` (or `above` / `below`) to only
  the cells whose y-range (or x-range) contains the pointer. Other
  rows stay put. After the drag the layout has a per-row column
  boundary; `findSharedEdges` detects each as a separate
  independently-draggable handle on the next render. The user can
  realign rows by dragging each independently.
- **`weather_now` no longer clips the sun row at narrow cell heights.**
  The grid was `auto 1fr auto auto` (header, hero, stats, sun); on
  wide-but-short cells (e.g. 1200×420) the auto rows + minimum hero
  exceeded the cell height and `overflow: hidden` clipped the bottom.
  Added a container query (`max-height: 420px`) that drops the sun
  row in that case, the size class was deciding on the longer side
  so a 1200×420 cell stayed `lg` and kept the sun row even when there
  wasn't room.

  Also explains why the bug was invisible in the editor preview: the
  preview iframe is `transform: scale(...)`'d down to fit the editor
  column (often ~0.4×), so 25 px of clipping at panel-native renders
  as a ~10 px sliver that reads as "the next section is just below
  the fold." The renderer screenshots at panel-native and the clip
  is obvious. Same auto-row-stack pattern lives in 9 other widgets;
  the same container-query fix can be applied per-widget if the bug
  reappears there too.

## [0.16.3], 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Dashboard editor preview iframe now auto-resets every 4 hours.**
  The composer iframe is mounted once when the editor opens, then
  runs forever, widget setInterval timers (clock, F1 countdown,
  public-transport refresh) accumulate small allocations every
  minute, and the webpage widget's auto-refresh swaps a foreign
  document in repeatedly. Over an overnight idle session those
  compound into multi-GB tab memory (saw 6.5 GB in the wild). A
  hard reset every 4 hours discards all accumulated state, the
  user sees nothing more than the same brief opacity fade as a
  normal save-driven reload.
- **`/renders/<digest>.png?w=<width>` thumbnail endpoint** with disk
  caching. Each row in the Events / Send-history feed previously
  loaded the full panel-sized PNG (1600×1200) into a `<img>`, which
  Chromium decoded to ~7.7 MB per element. With many push events
  retained in the bitmap cache, this also contributed to leaving
  admin tabs in the GB range. Templates + send.js + events.js now
  request the `?w=240` cached variant (~0.4 MB decoded per image),
  add `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` + explicit width/height
  to defer off-screen decode.
- **Events page default row limit** dropped from 200 to 100 so an
  initial page load doesn't pre-load 200 thumbnails (even at the
  reduced size).

### Added

- **`octoprint_status` widget**, live 3D-print monitor for an
  OctoPrint instance. Four canonical directions (r1 Refined, g2
  Geometric, s3 Swiss, d4 Data) pull printer state, job progress
  with ETA, and hotend/bed temperatures via OctoPrint's REST API.
  Includes a sample fixture for the dev gallery.

## [0.16.2], 2026-06-04

### Changed

- **Variant-picker label renamed "Direction" / "Layout" → "Style"**
  across 29 widget manifests. Same picker, friendlier name.
- **Picture widget caption strips no longer invert on dark themes.**
  `picture_apod`, `picture_apple_album`, `picture_gallery`, and
  `picture_unsplash` painted their Bauhaus caption strip with
  `var(--c-text)` background + `var(--c-bg)` foreground, which
  flipped to "dark on dark" the moment a dark theme was active.
  Swapped to the pinned `--wb-bar-bg` / `--wb-bar-fg` tokens
  (same fix as v0.14.3's github bars). Also added a `--theme-font`
  cascade at `:host` for the three widgets that were missing it,
  and replaced `picture_gallery`'s hard-coded `ui-monospace`
  filename font with `var(--theme-font-mono)`.
- **Calendar family links `widget-bauhaus.css`** in every `client.js`
  render path (calendar_day, calendar_month, calendar_week). Divider
  lines (`.d3-rule`, `.d5-rule`, `.w3-rule`, `.w5-rule`, `.m3-rule`,
  plus the `.m2-weekhead` / `.m2-grid` grid-gap backgrounds) now
  paint from `--c-line` instead of `--c-text` so dividers stay quiet
  rather than asserting as primary text. Fixed the
  `.w6-card-head` body inversion. All 6 variants per calendar widget
  retained.
- **`spotify_now_playing` dropdown label** "Layout" → "Style"
  (the five variant ids `split/cover/minimal/vinyl/stack` retained
  as a per-widget layout picker, see rulebook).

### Fixed

- **`ha_history` trend colour is now categorical, not status.** A
  rising temperature isn't a hazard and a dropping battery isn't
  "good"; the previous `--c-danger` / `--c-ok` mapping read as an
  alarm on themes where danger was loud red. Swapped to
  `--c-data-3` / `--c-data-2` so the trend reads as direction, not
  judgement.
- **`sky_aurora` spark bars now actually paint per-Kp colour.** The
  forecast bars rendered with `class="wb-bar"`, which (a) inherited
  the title-bar dark styling from `widget-bauhaus.css` and (b) made
  the colour rules in `client.css` (`.ar-bar.kp-quiet` etc.) match
  no elements. Renamed the class to `.ar-spark-bar`, fixed the CSS
  selectors to match, and added the missing flex/min-width baseline
  styling. Visible bug; all spark bars previously rendered
  identical dark grey instead of categorical Kp colours.

### Documentation

- **Rulebook ([`docs/widget-design-system.md`](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae/blob/main/docs/widget-design-system.md))**
  extended with grandfathered variant-id patterns: widget-keyed
  4-variant prefixes (the github family's `re1-re4`, `ci1-ci4`,
  `a1-a4`, `pr1-pr4`, `co1-co4`) are accepted as canonical-pattern
  variants; per-widget layout pickers (spotify_now_playing's
  `split/cover/minimal/vinyl/stack`) are accepted when variants
  describe layout shapes rather than design directions.
- **Audit notes** (`notes/widget-audit.md`, gitignored) updated with
  remediation status and the user-preference overrides applied
  during the v0.16.2 pass.

## [0.16.1], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`docs/widget-design-system.md`**, the cross-widget rulebook.
  Codifies variant naming (`r1/g2/s3/d4` canonical), title-bar
  discipline (`--wb-bar-h` mandatory for refined bars), font cascade
  (`--theme-font` wins), colour discipline (semantic vs categorical
  vs decorative), CSS class naming, and when to link
  `widget-bauhaus.css` / `widget-bauhaus-wx.css`. Sits alongside
  `widgets.md` (single-widget contract) and `widget-design-brief.md`
  (per-widget template) as the "across all widgets" reference;
  wired into the mkdocs nav.
- Quick-lint checklist at the end so a widget author can score their
  finished widget in 30 seconds against the rulebook.

No widget code changed, the rulebook describes what the best
current widgets already do. A separate audit (gitignored at
`notes/widget-audit.md`) catalogues per-widget deviations for a
post-launch cleanup pass.

## [0.16.0], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **`ha_todo` widget**, items from a Home Assistant todo list
  (built-in shopping list, Google Tasks, Microsoft To-Do, CalDAV,
  anything exposed as a `todo.*` entity). Four selectable visual
  directions matching the HA family convention:
  - `r1` Bauhaus Refined, dark header + numbered list with due dates
  - `g2` Bauhaus Geometric, colour-block tiles with status colour band
  - `s3` Swiss / International, hairline header + tabular rows
  - `d4` Data forward, big stat block (X open / Y done) + compact list
  Cell options: `entity_id` (picker filtered to `todo.*` entities),
  `title`, `max_items` (1–20), `include_completed`. Due-date tone
  reflects state, OVERDUE renders danger, TODAY warn, future muted.
  Total widget count: **57**.
- **`ha_core.call_service_with_response()`**, POST helper for HA's
  service calls that need a payload back (HA 2024.5+ `return_response`).
  General-purpose, not just todo: any service that supports
  `return_response` (e.g. weather forecasts, conversation agent
  responses) can now be called from widgets.

## [0.15.1], 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Page editor's Push button can't fire an unbound push anymore.**
  When devices are registered but none are bound to the current
  dashboard, the underlying ``send_page`` endpoint would render at
  the virtual-panel size and silently miss every device. The button
  is now disabled with a title explaining how to fix it; the device
  checklist auto-saves + reloads on change, so ticking a device
  re-enables Push without an extra save step. Pages with no devices
  registered at all (legacy single-head install) keep the enabled
  button, the virtual-panel fan-out is intentional there.
- **Send page Send buttons mirror the same guard.** Each tab's Send
  button (File / URL / Webpage / Gallery) is disabled until at least
  one target device is ticked, surfaces the missing pick before the
  user clicks instead of after a POST round-trip. The Saved-page tab
  is unaffected since it inherits the picked-page's bindings.
- **Send page validation failure preserves form input.** Posting
  with no device ticked, a missing URL, or invalid viewport dims
  used to redirect to ``/send`` and destroy everything the user had
  typed, paste the URL again, re-pick fit, re-pick gallery file.
  The Send routes now re-render in place via a new
  ``_render_send_with_form`` helper that round-trips the form
  values + the picked device IDs through the template, so a fix is
  one corrected field and one resubmit.

### Added

- **`spotify_queue` widget**, current track + next few items from
  your Spotify queue. Refined Bauhaus shell with the standard
  `--wb-bar-h` header, accent-band lede showing now-playing + album
  art, and a numbered list of upcoming tracks (title / artist /
  duration). Two cell options: `max_items` (1–12, default 6) and
  `show_now_playing` (drop the lede for a queue-only feed).
  Total widget count: **56**.
- **`spotify_core.queue()`** wraps `GET /v1/me/player/queue` with the
  same OAuth + token-refresh dance as `now_playing()`. The endpoint
  is Premium-only, a 403 surfaces as a clear *"Spotify Premium is
  required to read the queue."* error, not a bare HTTP code. No
  re-auth needed: the existing `user-read-playback-state` scope
  already covers the queue endpoint.

## [0.14.4], 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **news_reddit no longer deadlocks the renderer during a push.** The
  widget's fetch used to submit a `FetchRequest` to the same
  `BrowserPool` that was currently running the screenshot, the
  pool's single worker was busy with the render, so reddit's fetch
  blocked behind its own render until the hydration overall cap
  fired (~12 s). On a dashboard that includes reddit, that ate most
  of the renderer's 15 s `goto` budget, leaving only ~3 s for the
  `load` event + post-load image / font wait, enough margin under
  light load, but the trigger for the intermittent
  ``Page.goto: Timeout 15000ms exceeded`` errors users hit on
  HA-driven pushes (cold widget caches at random hours of the day).

  The fetch path is now context-aware:

  * **Editor / dev gallery** (``ctx["preview"]=True``), urllib
    against ``old.reddit.com`` first (less aggressively filtered
    than ``www.reddit.com``), falling through to the BrowserPool
    only if urllib fails. The pool's Chromium TLS/JA3 fingerprint
    is still available as a backstop when needed.
  * **Push render** (``ctx["preview"]=False``), the pool path is
    skipped entirely; urllib only. If urllib 403s the composer's
    last-good fallback ([app/composer.py:163](app/composer.py#L163))
    serves the prior payload so the cell still renders.

  The urllib path also gained a fuller browser-like header set
  (Accept-Language, Sec-Fetch-*, ``Cookie: over18=1``) so the
  Reddit bot filter accepts it more often.

## [0.14.3], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Renderer retries `Page.goto` on transient Playwright
  `TimeoutError`.** ``RenderRequest.max_attempts`` (default 3)
  controls how many fresh-context attempts each render gets. Each
  retry tears down the half-loaded page + context so the next try
  starts clean. Only timeouts retry, other Playwright errors
  (invalid URL, browser-side crash, frame detached) surface
  immediately so we don't burn the deadline on something that
  won't recover. The browser pool's outer deadline scales with
  ``max_attempts`` so the worst-case 3×15s retry fits. The
  intermittent failure mode this fixes: HA-driven pushes that
  surfaced as ``Page.goto: Timeout 15000ms exceeded`` under no
  obvious cause, usually a brief loopback contention or a
  background-thread GC pause that ate the navigation window.

### Fixed

- **github widget title bars now match every other refined widget.**
  The five github widgets (`github_repo`, `github_actions`,
  `github_activity`, `github_contributions`, `github_pr_queue`) had
  hard-coded `clamp(...)` bar dimensions and didn't link
  `widget-bauhaus.css`, so their bars shrank with cell size instead
  of pinning to the shared `--wb-bar-h` / `--wb-bar-px` /
  `--wb-bar-fs` tokens. Each widget now `<link>`s
  `widget-bauhaus.css` and the `.gh-dark` / `.re1-dark` selectors
  read from the shared `--wb-bar-*` vars, so every github bar lands
  at the same physical pixel height as reddit / HA / weather bars
  across every zoom level. Background + colour also flipped to
  `--wb-bar-bg` / `--wb-bar-fg` so dark themes don't render the
  bar as "dark on dark".

## [0.14.2], 2026-06-03

### Changed

- **Telemetry copy: drop the finger-wag.** `docs/privacy.md` had a
  bolded "You control whether to send; you don't control where it
  goes." line right after the explanation of why the endpoint is
  hard-coded; the preceding sentence already makes that point, so
  the restatement read as a lecture without adding substance.
  Removed. Matching line in `app/telemetry.py`'s module docstring
  removed too for consistency.

## [0.14.1], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Home Assistant integration doc** (`docs/install/home-assistant.md`)
  covering both the HA Add-on / Ingress install path and the MQTT
  auto-discovery surface, plus a webhook-from-HA RESTful-command
  example.
- **Webhook push, backup / export-import, and mDNS docs** added as
  sections in `docs/install/server.md` (the endpoints have been in
  the code for releases but were not user-documented).
- **Theme tokens section** in `docs/widgets.md` covers the full
  `--c-*` semantic layer (now 15 tokens with the `info` primitive),
  the decorative `--wx-*` layer (paper / ink / chromatic chips,
  type roles) used by the weather + sky widget family, the
  per-cell `--c-zoom` counter-scaling math, and the
  `--theme-font` / `--theme-font-mono` cascade so widgets respect
  the font picker.
- **`variant` cell-option pattern** documented in both
  `docs/widgets.md` and `docs/dev/writing-a-plugin.md`, the
  convention 28 shipped widgets use to ship multiple visual
  directions (Refined / Geometric / Swiss / Data / etc.) through a
  single dropdown.
- **TRMNL HTTP-pull pipeline** documented across
  `docs/install/clients.md`, `docs/install/devices.md`,
  `docs/install/server.md`, `docs/dev/architecture.md`, and
  `docs/compatibility.md`, pairing flow, the `/api/setup`,
  `/api/display`, `/api/log` endpoints, and the `trmnl_png`
  renderer's dither options.
- **Composition workflow walkthrough** in
  `docs/install/devices.md`, pick a layout preset, assign widgets
  per cell, tune via the per-cell zoom slider, bind devices.

### Changed

- **Documentation counts corrected throughout.** Widget count
  47 → 55, palette tokens 14 → 15, layout presets 17 → 10,
  themes 21 → 31, fonts 15 → 17, Phosphor weights 4 → 6,
  renderers 3 → 4, device kinds 3 → 4. mDNS hostname corrected
  to plain `tesserae.local` (the `tesserae-<id>.local` form is
  ESP32 captive-portal only).
- **Architecture pipeline diagram** in `docs/dev/architecture.md`
  now shows the TRMNL `trmnl_png` renderer + `trmnl_client` device,
  the HTTP-pull transport side-by-side with MQTT, and adds sections
  for the HTTP-pull API, the webhook push endpoint, and HA MQTT
  discovery.
- **Widget design brief** (`docs/widget-design-brief.md`) icon
  manifest flipped from `fill` weights to `bold` (fill was
  contradicting `docs/widgets.md` which calls out fill as the
  Spectra-6-quantises-into-blobs weight). Tone-rules example
  reworked so it uses semantic tokens explicitly (`--c-data-*` for
  decorative, `--c-ok/warn/danger` for genuine status).
- **`scripts/capture_widget_shots.py`** gained a login flow
  matching `scripts/widget_contact_sheet.py` (POST `/login`,
  forward the session cookie into the Playwright context) so
  rerunning the screenshot capture doesn't trip the auth gate.
  Drives via `TESSERAE_PASSWORD` env or `--password`.
- **`scripts/gen_compatibility.py` + `docs/_data/tested.json`**
  taught about the `trmnl_png` renderer and the `tesserae-trmnl-client`
  reference repo so the compatibility table includes the Kindle
  Paperwhite 2 / KOReader row.
- **README + index** copy refreshed: `first-class` framing
  dropped (banned per project voice), "Tesserae is young"
  softened to match the v0.14 feature surface, TRMNL transport
  surfaced alongside Pi/ESP32, four-client landscape made
  explicit.
- **CHANGELOG backfilled** with 0.13.0 / 0.13.1 / 0.13.2 / 0.14.0
  entries and the `[Unreleased]` compare link / version refs that
  had been silently stale since v0.8.x.
- **SECURITY.md** supported-versions table bumped to 0.14.x;
  scope expanded to include the TRMNL client repo and the HA
  Add-on companion repo.
- **55 per-widget screenshots regenerated** against the current
  styling, with the 8 new HA / weather widgets that landed in 0.13 /
  0.14 captured for the first time.

## [0.14.0], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Two new bundled fonts.** `fonts_core` now ships **Archivo**
  (400 / 700 / 800) and **Space Mono** (400 / 700), bringing the
  total to 17 typefaces. Archivo is the Bauhaus widget family's
  default sans; Space Mono lands as the matched monospace.
- **Image-wait render phase.** The headless renderer now blocks the
  screenshot on every cell's `<img>` finishing its load (5 s cap,
  walks every shadow root). Fixes HA camera snapshots, Spotify album
  art, Unsplash CDN images, and any other widget that fetches via a
  plain `<img src>`, previously the screenshot fired during the
  download and captured a half-loaded / broken-image frame. New
  `images=N.NN` phase appears in the render-timing log.

### Changed

- **wx widget palette flows through theme tokens.** The decorative
  `--wx-paper` / `--wx-ink` / `--wx-paper-2/3` / `--wx-ink-60` /
  `--wx-hair` tokens (used across the weather + sky widget family)
  now resolve from the cell host's `--c-bg` / `--c-text` /
  `--c-text-soft` / `--c-line` so the widget body retints with the
  active theme. The Bauhaus title bar stays pinned dark via the new
  dedicated `--wb-bar-bg` / `--wb-bar-fg` tokens so refined widgets
  don't flip to "light bar on dark body" under dark themes.
- **Decorative `--wx-*` font role tokens lead with the theme font.**
  `--wx-grotesk`, `--wx-black`, `--wx-geo`, `--wx-mono`, `--wx-swiss`
  now reference `var(--theme-font, ...)` first so the user's font
  picker actually wins over the Bauhaus default; the Bauhaus family
  stays as the fallback.
- **HA refined widgets cascade `widget-bauhaus.css` +
  `widget-bauhaus-wx.css`.** `ha_sensor`, `ha_climate`, `ha_history`,
  and `ha_entities` now link both shared stylesheets so the
  `--wb-bar-*` and `--wx-*` tokens resolve consistently with the
  weather widgets, refined title bars across the whole family land
  at the same physical pixel size at every zoom level.

### Fixed

- **Multiselect option click yanked the page to the top.** The hidden
  checkbox inside `.multiselect-opt` was clipped to a 1×1 footprint
  via `clip-path: inset(50%)`, which made the browser's auto-focus
  `scrollIntoView` think the focused element was at the parent
  label's position, clicking an option further down the scrollable
  list bubbled up to the document and scrolled the whole page. Now
  the checkbox is `opacity: 0` and sized to fill the option label
  (which is `position: relative`), so the auto-focus scroll target is
  already in view and the page stays put.

## [0.13.2], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Refined title bars pinned to physical pixels.** Shared
  `--wb-bar-h` / `--wb-bar-px` / `--wb-bar-fs` / `--wb-bar-icon-sz` /
  `--wb-mark-sz` CSS vars on `:host` in `widget-bauhaus.css`
  counter-scale by `var(--c-zoom, 1)` so every refined title bar
  lands at the same 36 physical pixels at every zoom level -
  consistent across `.wb-bar`, `.wx-header-dark`, and every
  per-widget header in the HA family.
- **Dev-mode data import.** `Settings → System → Data → Import`
  is callable in `--dev` mode, previously it refused; now it
  flashes a "stop and restart manually" hint instead of trying to
  `os.execv` the dev process.

## [0.13.1], 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **CI mypy failure on `widget_samples.py`.** The `_ha_battery`
  sample builder mixed-typed dict made mypy infer `level` as
  `object`; rebound through a typed `list[tuple[str, int]]` staging
  list and a `copy.deepcopy` result captured in a typed local before
  return.

## [0.13.0], 2026-06-03

### Added

- **Data export / import.** `Settings → System → Data` exports your
  entire Tesserae install (pages, themes, devices, plugin settings,
  secrets) as a single ZIP, and imports a ZIP from another install.
  Every file is validated against the matching JSON Schema before
  writing; Docker / HA Add-on installs restart in place, venv
  installs flash a "stop and restart" hint so nothing is left
  mid-flight.
- **`info` palette primitive + `--c-info` semantic token.** Themes
  can now define an `info` colour for informational status
  (in addition to `ok` / `warn` / `danger`); `--c-info` falls back
  to `--theme-accent` when a theme omits it.
- **Snap-to-grid layout editor.** The "Custom layout" disclosure on
  the page editor gains a snap-to-grid toggle with adjustable cols /
  rows, useful when a preset doesn't quite fit but you don't want
  fractional drag-resize.
- **8 new weather + sky widget variants.** Each of the existing 8
  weather widgets gains 4 visual directions (Refined / Geometric /
  Swiss / Data) selectable via a `variant` cell option, plus a
  brand-new `weather_wind` widget.
- **7 new Home Assistant widgets.** `ha_battery`, `ha_camera`,
  `ha_energy`, `ha_lights`, `ha_locks`, `ha_media`, `ha_zones`. The
  existing 5 HA widgets also get a polish pass (refined Bauhaus
  title bar, decorative-vs-status tone clean-up).
- **Dev widget gallery.** `/_test/widgets` (dev-only) renders every
  widget at every size on one page for a "did anything regress?"
  scan during a polish pass.

### Changed

- **Decorative vs status colour discipline.** Audit pass across every
  bundled widget, every decorative use of `--c-ok` / `--c-warn` /
  `--c-danger` got rerouted through `--c-data-*` (categorical) so the
  status hues are reserved for genuine advisories / hazards / errors
  only. Themes can now retune status colours without warping weather
  / calendar / news colour blocking.
- **Dark Bauhaus title bar on remaining refined HA widgets.** Final
  refined widgets that were still using their own header styling
  switched over to the shared `--wb-bar-*` tokens; every refined
  header in the bundle now reads identically.

## [0.12.14], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **`github_repo` widget showed "No commit activity" on active
  repos.** GitHub's `/stats/commit_activity` endpoint is async, the
  first request returns HTTP 202 with an empty body while GitHub
  builds the stats; subsequent requests get the real data. Our
  `request_json` was crashing on the empty body
  (`json.loads("")` → `JSONDecodeError`), the widget caught the
  exception, set `activity = []`, and **cached that empty result for
  10 minutes**, so even after GitHub finished computing, the widget
  kept rendering empty until the cache expired.
  - `github_core.request_json` now raises a dedicated
    `GithubAcceptedError` on 202 responses instead of choking on an
    empty body.
  - `github_repo` catches that error explicitly and **skips writing
    the cache** when stats are still computing, so the next render
    picks up the real data.
  - For already-cached empty results (the ones currently sticking
    around for users hit by this), the widget now ignores a cached
    entry whose `commit_weeks` is empty and refetches, self-heals
    without waiting for the 10-minute TTL.

## [0.12.13], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **First push of a dashboard with a slow upstream painted
  "TimeoutError" into the cell; pushing again worked.** Users found
  themselves manually double-pushing because the executor's stragglers
  finished after the timeout and populated the on-disk cache, so the
  second attempt hit cache and rendered fine. The composer now keeps a
  process-lifetime "last-good" cache keyed on
  (plugin_id, options, panel_w, panel_h); when a widget hydration
  errors (or exceeds the 12s overall cap), we fall back to the most
  recent successful result for the same key instead of rendering an
  error state. Net effect: a transient upstream blip shows
  stale-but-real data, not red error text. Cleared on process restart
  (a fresh install has no fallback to serve anyway).

## [0.12.12], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Renders still capped at 73s even after v0.12.11's hydration fix.**
  The per-phase log surfaced the real culprit: a 57s `evaluate` phase
  every time. Root cause was `page.goto(wait_until="networkidle")`.
  Widget client.js imports, font fetches, and the Phosphor icon CSS
  keep the network busy long after the page is visually ready, so
  `networkidle` timed out on every render. When that timed out,
  Playwright aborted the navigation, putting the page in a
  half-aborted state where the next `page.evaluate` stalled for
  ~60s waiting for stability. Two changes to fix:
  * `page.goto` now waits for `load` (deterministic, fast).
  * `composer.js` sets `window.__tesseraeComposed = true` after every
    cell mount-promise resolves; the renderer polls for that flag via
    `page.wait_for_function`, which is a precise "ready to screenshot"
    signal rather than the squishy `networkidle`.
  Per-phase log now includes a `compose=` field separate from `goto=`
  so a stuck-widget mount can be diagnosed independently from a slow
  page-load.

## [0.12.11], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Hydration timeouts (45s overall / 35s per widget) blew past the
  renderer's 15s `page.goto` budget.** Caught by the per-phase render
  log added in v0.12.8: a Weather dashboard push showed
  `goto=15.02s evaluate=57.44s screenshot=0.19s`, total 73s, with a
  matching `page hydration overall timeout (45.0s)` warning. The
  server was still computing the response when Playwright timed out,
  so the browser saw a delayed/aborted navigation and the `evaluate`
  call stalled waiting for the page to stabilise. Hydration is now
  capped at 12s overall / 10s per widget so the compose endpoint
  always responds inside `goto`'s 15s window. Widgets whose upstream
  doesn't respond in 10s render an error state for that cycle rather
  than holding up the dashboard.

- **`weather_pollen_count` blocked hydration with a slow Melbourne
  scrape.** The fallback HTML scrape of `melbournepollen.com.au`
  still used bare `urllib.request.urlopen` with the 15s widget-level
  timeout, on top of the open-meteo fetch, worst case 46s for that
  one widget alone, blowing the new hydration cap. Switched to a new
  `app.plugin_http.fetch_text` helper (5s timeout, no retries -
  it's an explicitly-best-effort fallback).

### Added

- **`fetch_text()` in `app.plugin_http`**, sibling to `fetch_json`
  for non-JSON endpoints (HTML scrapes, RSS feeds). Same retry +
  backoff machinery; defaults to zero retries since text-scrape
  fallbacks shouldn't be retried into hydration timeouts.

## [0.12.10], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **F1 widgets surface `TimeoutError` when the Jolpica F1 API blips.**
  The four F1 plugins (`f1_next`, `f1_last_race`, `f1_weekend`,
  `f1_standings_drivers`) still used bare `urllib.request.urlopen`
  with a 10s timeout, same fragile pattern v0.12.5 fixed in the
  weather widgets but never propagated to F1. Switched them to
  `app.plugin_http.fetch_json` (15s timeout, one retry, 1s backoff),
  so a transient SSL handshake hang on jolpi.ca no longer paints
  "TimeoutError: the read operation timed out" into the cell.

## [0.12.9], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Widget data fetches now run in parallel per page render.** The
  hydration loop in `app/composer.py` fetched each cell's `server.py`
  fetch() serially: six widgets each waiting 15s on a slow upstream
  meant 90s of compose-endpoint time, which blew past Playwright's
  navigation budget and surfaced as a blank PNG or a "TimeoutError:
  the read operation timed out" rendered into the cell. Hydration now
  uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (max 8 workers), so a dashboard's
  render time is bound by the slowest single widget rather than
  their sum. Two safety caps: per-widget 35s, overall 45s, beyond
  those an unfinished cell gets a synthetic `{"error": …}` so the
  widget template renders a clean failure state rather than blocking
  the whole page.

## [0.12.8], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Renders capped at exactly the 75s BrowserPool deadline, surfacing
  as a bare "render:" error in History.** `page.set_default_timeout`
  governs Playwright actions (evaluate, click) but not navigation, so
  `page.goto` was using the upstream 30s default rather than our 15s.
  `goto + fallback + evaluate + screenshot` could sum to ~75s and
  race the pool's outer 75s future deadline; the resulting
  `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` stringifies to an empty string,
  which is why the History row showed `render:` with no detail.
  Renderer now sets `set_default_navigation_timeout` too, and
  `push.py` falls back to the exception type name when the message is
  empty so future failures self-explain.

### Added

- **Per-phase render timing in the add-on log.** Each headless render
  now logs `goto / evaluate / screenshot` durations next to the
  composed URL. "Why is this push taking 70s?" investigations get a
  concrete breadcrumb instead of guesswork.

## [0.12.7], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Pushes failing with "Execution context was destroyed" after ~75s.**
  Under HA, every dashboard push from the user's edge install fell
  through with that Playwright error, suggesting the persistent
  BrowserPool's Chromium had got into a state where `new_context()`
  produced pages whose evaluate hooks raced with an unfinished
  navigation. Two defenses: the `_FONT_WAIT_JS` evaluate is now
  best-effort (a missed font wait beats a whole-render fail), and the
  BrowserPool's exception handler now treats "Execution context was
  destroyed" / "target … has been closed" the same as a dead browser
 , drops the handle so the next render relaunches Chromium cleanly,
  even when `is_connected()` still returns True.

## [0.12.6], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Brand mark as a real asset.** The in-nav brand mark was previously
  only available as a pure-CSS shape, so the browser tab showed a
  generic icon and the HA add-on store had no graphic. New
  `static/brand/icon.svg` bakes the shape into a vector that the
  browser tab and HA add-on share. A small `scripts/render_brand.py`
  rasterises the SVG into PNGs (128 for the HA sidebar, 32 for the
  Safari favicon fallback, 512 for future social cards). The HA stable
  + edge add-on directories now ship the 128 PNG as `icon.png`.

## [0.12.5], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Chart.js 404'd under HA Ingress on the four chart-using widgets.**
  `finance_currency`, `finance_crypto`, `finance_stock`, and
  `weather_hourly` all loaded Chart.js by creating a `<script>` and
  setting `src = "/static/vendor/chart.umd.min.js"`, and because
  that script lives in `document.head`, not in the widget's shadow
  root, v0.12.4's shadow-DOM URL sweep didn't touch it. Patched the
  four widgets to prepend `window.TESSERAE_URL_PREFIX` themselves.
- **Weather widgets occasionally flashed an SSL handshake / URL
  timeout error.** A flaky LAN or a slow upstream (Open-Meteo / pollen
  sites) caused a single hung request to fail the whole render. New
  `app/plugin_http.py` adds a tiny `fetch_json` helper with one retry
  + 1s backoff and a bumped 15s timeout; the five weather plugins
  (`now`, `forecast`, `hourly`, `air_quality`, `pollen_count`) use it
  instead of bare `urllib.request.urlopen`. A blip on the first try
  no longer surfaces an error in the cell.

## [0.12.4], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Widgets rendered with no CSS, fonts, or icons inside the HA Ingress
  composer / preview.** Every widget's `client.js` set
  `shadow.innerHTML` with root-relative `<link href="/static/…">` and
  `<link href="/plugins/…">`. Inside the ingress iframe those resolved
  to the HA host root and 404'd, so each shadow DOM rendered with
  default user-agent styles. `composer.js` now walks the freshly-
  rendered shadow root and prepends `TESSERAE_URL_PREFIX` to root-
  relative `href` / `src` attributes, one place, catches all 51
  widget files without touching them.
- **Inter / JetBrains Mono fonts missing under HA Ingress.** The
  `@font-face` rules in `static/style/base.css` used absolute
  `url("/plugins/fonts_core/…")` which resolved against the HA host
  root. Switched to CSS-relative `url("../../plugins/fonts_core/…")` so
  the browser resolves them against `base.css`'s own URL, works with
  or without an ingress prefix without runtime substitution.
- **Tesserae nav logo took users back to the HA dashboard.** The brand
  link in `_base.html` was a hardcoded `href="/"` which inside the
  ingress iframe meant the HA host root, not Tesserae's index. Now
  uses `url_for('index')`.
- **Onboarding "Edit page" + plugin admin links + Events thumbnails +
  device-discovery poller** all used absolute paths that bypassed the
  ingress prefix. All switched to `url_for(...)` or
  `request.script_root + …`.
- **Headless renderer hit the wrong loopback port on Edge.** The Edge
  add-on publishes its API on host port 8766, container 8765, but
  `to_loopback_url` preserved the URL's port (8766), so it tried
  `http://127.0.0.1:8766` inside the container where nothing was
  listening. A new `TESSERAE_BIND_PORT` env var (set in both add-on
  configs) tells the renderer which internal port the server actually
  binds, independent of the host-side mapping.

## [0.12.3], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **HA Add-on Configuration tab now actually wires through.** The
  `log_level`, `mqtt_host`, `mqtt_port`, `mqtt_username`, and
  `mqtt_password` options were declared in `config.yaml` but went
  nowhere, users had to set the same values twice (once in HA's
  form, once in Tesserae's Settings → MQTT broker page). A new
  `app/ha_options.py` reads `/data/options.json` on every container
  start (HA mode only) and applies log level to the root logger and
  MQTT details to the broker settings section. HA Configuration is
  now the canonical source for these fields; Tesserae's Settings →
  MQTT broker card hides `host`/`port`/`username`/`password` under HA
  and shows a "managed in the add-on's Configuration tab" blurb. The
  card keeps `keepalive` and `client_id` editable since they have no
  HA equivalent. Telemetry / mDNS / HA discovery / browser warmup
  intentionally stay Tesserae-side, those are user-tunable consent
  or runtime knobs, not connection config.

## [0.12.2], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **Panel URLs under HA Ingress pointed at HA's port (8123), not
  Tesserae's.** `_capture_http_port` read `request.host` on every
  request and stashed the port. Inside Ingress that host is the HA
  frontend (`homeassistant.local:8123`), so every MQTT push payload
  ended up with `http://<lan-ip>:8123/renders/…`, devices 404'd at
  HA. The before-request hook now short-circuits when
  `X-Ingress-Path` is present; under Ingress we fall back to
  `TESSERAE_HTTP_PORT` / the default 8765 instead, matching the
  add-on's actual host port mapping.

## [0.12.1], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **"Importing a module script failed." on every widget under HA
  Ingress.** `composer.js` did `import("/plugins/<id>/client.js")`
  with an absolute path, inside the ingress iframe that resolves to
  the HA host root and 404s with an HTML response, which the browser
  reports as a module-import failure. The compose page now exposes
  `window.TESSERAE_URL_PREFIX` the same way `_base.html` does, and the
  dynamic import prepends it. The three F1 widgets (`f1_next`,
  `f1_last_race`, `f1_weekend`) that absolute-imported the shared
  `f1_core/static/circuits.js` helper now use a relative import so
  they're prefix-independent.

## [0.12.0], 2026-06-02

### Breaking

- **Default HTTP port is now 8765** (was 8000). Picked to dodge the
  pile of dev tooling that owns 8000 (Django runserver, `python -m
  http.server`, generic admin UIs) so a fresh `docker compose up`
  doesn't immediately collide with whatever else the user has. Affects
  every entry point, `tesserae --port`, the Dockerfile EXPOSE, the
  compose example, the install.sh / install.ps1 prompt default, mDNS,
  and `TESSERAE_HTTP_PORT`'s fallback. ESP32 / Pi firmware images with
  `:8000` baked into the saved base URL will need their Tesserae URL
  re-pointed; the panel listeners pick up the new URL on the next push
  once you update it. The HA Add-on (stable) now exposes host `8765`;
  the Edge add-on uses host `8766` so the two can run side-by-side and
  both stay LAN-reachable.

### Changed

- **Built-in broker disabled under the HA Add-on.** Home Assistant's
  bundled Mosquitto add-on already owns port 1883 on the host, so
  running Tesserae's embedded amqtt alongside it creates two brokers
  on the same address, devices end up talking to whichever one their
  client happens to hit, and nothing reliable works. Inside an HA
  install the Settings → MQTT broker card hides every `embedded_*`
  field (toggle included) and the onboarding wizard skips the
  "use built-in" path and pre-fills Host with `core-mosquitto`. The
  transport-rebuild path treats `embedded_enabled` as false under HA
  regardless of saved settings, so a legacy config import can't
  re-enable it.

### Fixed

- **Events page indicator stuck on "offline" inside HA Ingress.** The
  Events page (and the live History tab on Send) opened `EventSource`
  against a root-relative `/events/stream` path. Inside the Ingress
  iframe that resolves to the Home Assistant host root, not the add-on,
  so the connection failed immediately and the indicator flipped to
  offline even though SSE / MQTT were both fine. The same bug affected
  the icon picker's Phosphor manifest fetch and the editor preview
  fetch. The base template now exposes `window.TESSERAE_URL_PREFIX`
  (Flask's `request.script_root`, the ingress prefix the WSGI
  middleware extracted from `X-Ingress-Path`, empty otherwise), and the
  four affected JS sites prepend it.
- **Noisy `ha_discovery` tracebacks during broker reconnect / shutdown.**
  When the MQTT transport is explicitly disconnected (settings swap,
  process exit), the discovery publishers used to fire a full
  `RuntimeError` stack trace per retained config, dozens of them per
  shutdown. Discovery configs are already retained on the broker and
  get re-published when discovery next starts, so we now skip publishes
  silently when the transport is disconnected and log any in-flight
  disconnect race at `debug` instead of `warning` with `exc_info`.
  Other publish failures still log loudly with a traceback.

## [0.11.17], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **MQTT client-id collisions between two installs sharing one
  broker.** A bare-metal Tesserae and the HA Add-on Tesserae both
  pointing at HA's bundled `core-mosquitto` saw "MQTT disconnected:
  Unspecified error" every couple of seconds, the broker evicted
  whichever client connected second the moment its duplicate
  client-id was already in use. The default client-id resolver now
  appends a 6-character hex suffix persisted to
  `data/core/.mqtt_client_id_suffix`. Random so it doesn't
  coordinate between hosts; persistent so MQTT subscriptions stay
  attached to a stable id across restarts; one-shot so existing
  installs don't get a new id and lose their retained-message
  bindings on upgrade, they'll generate one on first restart and
  hold it from then on. Settings → Broker → MQTT client id still
  overrides everything.

## [0.11.16], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **HA Add-on: panel base_url pointed at the docker bridge IP.**
  Tesserae's `detect_local_ip()` used a UDP-getsockname trick to find
  the host's outbound IPv4. Under `host_network: false` (which all HA
  Add-ons use) the trick returns the docker bridge address
  (172.x.x.x), which no LAN client can reach. Panels listening for
  MQTT push frames or polling the TRMNL BYOS endpoint at that URL
  would silently fail. Resolution order is now:
  1. `TESSERAE_HOST_IP` env var (unchanged, always wins).
  2. HA Supervisor's `/network/info` API, picks the primary
     interface's IPv4 address. Only reachable when
     `hassio_api: true` is set on the add-on (both add-on definitions
     bump that in the companion repo).
  3. The existing UDP-getsockname trick.

  Result is cached for the process lifetime so we don't hammer the
  Supervisor API on every `detect_local_ip()` call (multiple admin
  routes / page renders use it).

## [0.11.15], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **HA Add-on edge channel.** Every push to `main` now builds and
  publishes a per-commit Docker tag
  `ghcr.io/dmellok/tesserae:<pyproject>-edge.<sha7>` (in addition
  to the existing `:main` and `:latest`). The companion add-on repo
  gained a parallel `tesserae-edge/` add-on definition that tracks
  those tags via the sync-addon workflow, which now has two jobs:
  - `bump-stable`, fires on `release: published`, edits
    `tesserae/config.yaml`.
  - `bump-edge`, fires on `push: branches: [main]`, edits
    `tesserae-edge/config.yaml` to the per-commit edge version.
  HA users see two add-ons in the store. Stable installs the
  released Tesserae; edge installs whatever's on `main` right now.
  Both can be installed in parallel (different `slug:`, different
  persistent `/data` volume); edge intentionally doesn't expose
  port 8000 on the host so it can coexist with stable.

## [0.11.14], 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- **HA Add-on: `PermissionError` on `/data/plugins` on first boot.**
  The Docker entrypoint chowns `/app/data` to `pwuser` so the
  un-privileged worker can write to it after gosu-drops; it didn't
  know about `TESSERAE_DATA_ROOT` (added in 0.11.13), so when HA
  Supervisor mounted `/data` root-owned the gosu-dropped Tesserae
  process EPERM'd on the first `mkdir`. Entrypoint now also chowns
  `TESSERAE_DATA_ROOT` when set and different from `/app/data`.

## [0.11.13], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **`is_homeassistant` flag in telemetry.** Sits alongside `is_docker`
  on both `app.started` and `app.heartbeat`. True when the
  `TESSERAE_HA_INGRESS=1` env var is set (the companion HA Add-on
  exports it via its `config.yaml` `environment:` section). Lets the
  maintainer see the HA-Add-on subset of the installed fleet as it
  grows. No content sent, just a single `true` / `false` deployment
  flag, same shape as `is_docker`.
- **`TESSERAE_DATA_ROOT` env var** to override the data directory. The
  HA Add-on sets this to `/data` so Tesserae's settings, dashboards,
  schedules and event log land on HA Supervisor's per-add-on
  persistent volume, which Supervisor automatically backs up across
  add-on upgrades.

### Fixed

- **HA Ingress 404 on first install.** The URL-prefix middleware
  (added in 0.11.11) was only wrapping the WSGI app when
  `TESSERAE_HA_INGRESS=1` was set, AND the add-on's `image:` field
  was bypassing the custom Dockerfile that set that env var. Net
  result: Tesserae's `/` redirected to `/setup` with a bare
  `Location: /setup`, the iframe followed it to HA's root, and HA
  itself 404'd. The middleware now always wraps (it's a no-op when
  there's no `X-Ingress-Path` header), and the add-on's `config.yaml`
  uses `environment:` to set the env var directly. The auth-gate
  bypass still requires both env var + header, that part stays
  belt-and-braces.

## [0.11.12], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **CI workflow that syncs the companion HA Add-on repo on each
  published Release.** Watches `release: published`; on each new
  Release, bumps `tesserae/config.yaml` `version:`, the
  `Dockerfile`'s `ghcr.io/dmellok/tesserae:<tag>` reference, and
  prepends a CHANGELOG entry on
  [dmellok/homeassistant-tesserae-addon](https://github.com/dmellok/homeassistant-tesserae-addon).
  Requires an `ADDON_REPO_PAT` secret on this repo (fine-grained PAT
  with Contents: read+write on the add-on repo only). Patch tags
  without a matching GitHub Release do NOT churn the add-on.

## [0.11.11], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Home Assistant Add-on / Ingress support.** Opt in by setting the
  `TESSERAE_HA_INGRESS=1` env var (the companion HA Add-on does this
  automatically). When set:
  - A WSGI middleware reads the `X-Ingress-Path` header HA Supervisor
    sets on every proxied request and patches `SCRIPT_NAME` so
    Flask's `url_for` emits URLs that resolve inside the iframe.
  - The auth gate bypasses Tesserae's own password gate when the
    `X-Ingress-Path` header is present (HA Supervisor authenticated
    upstream).
  - Both checks are belt-and-braces: env var alone won't bypass auth
    without the header, header alone won't bypass without the env
    var. A stray header from a misconfigured reverse proxy on a
    non-ingress install can't sneak past.

  The companion add-on lives at
  [dmellok/homeassistant-tesserae-addon](https://github.com/dmellok/homeassistant-tesserae-addon).

## [0.11.10], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **App footer with version + GitHub link.** Subtle dotted-underline
  link in the bottom margin of every page, deep-linked to the
  matching release tag on GitHub (`/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`). Reads as
  "Tesserae v0.11.10". 60% opacity by default, brightens to 95% on
  hover. Pure cosmetic; no layout impact above the fold.

## [0.11.9], 2026-06-02

### Added

- **Update + Rollback show a modal with a throbber and stage hint.**
  Clicking "Update & restart" used to freeze the tab for 30+ seconds
  during git fetch + pip install and then show a browser connection
  error during the os.execv restart. Now a modal pops up with a
  spinner ("Pulling the new revision…" → "Installing dependencies if
  needed…" → "Almost there…" → "Restarting…"), polls /healthz until
  the server comes back, and auto-reloads the page. Same flow for
  the Rollback button (which carries the same restart cost). Pure
  client-side wiring; no backend changes.

### Fixed

- **Send page History tab now actually live-updates after a push.**
  v0.11.8 wired the SSE subscription but listened for the wrong
  event name (``event`` / default ``onmessage``), so push events
  came through under the SSE endpoint's actual name (``log``) and
  were silently dropped. Listener corrected to ``log``.

## [0.11.8], 2026-06-02

### Changed

- **Send page's History tab updates live.** v0.11.7 backgrounded the
  push so the browser didn't freeze, but the History tab still
  required a manual reload to see the new row land. Subscribed it to
  the same `/events/stream?type=push` SSE feed the Events tab uses;
  on each push event, the tab refreshes the history list in place
  (debounced 300 ms to collapse multi-target fan-outs into one swap).

## [0.11.7], 2026-06-02

### Changed

- **Send page no longer blocks the browser on long renders.** All
  five Send-tab POSTs (File, Saved page, URL, Webpage, Gallery) and
  the History "Resend" button now hand the push off to a daemon
  thread and redirect immediately with a "queued" flash. The actual
  render + transport (5–15 s for a 1600×1200 panel) happens off the
  request thread; results stream into the History tab live via the
  existing SSE event log. No more frozen tab.
- Tests run the bg path synchronously (under `app.testing`) so
  ``assert_called_with`` patterns stay deterministic.

## [0.11.6], 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- mypy `--strict` was failing in CI on the v0.11.5 `BrowserPool`
  worker because the queue's union type `Future[bytes] | Future[str]`
  didn't narrow when `request` was narrowed by `isinstance(request,
  FetchRequest)`. Cast the future explicitly on each branch.

## [0.11.5], 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **`news_reddit` widget gets a Chromium-fingerprinted fetch path.**
  Reddit's public RSS feed intermittently blocks plain `urllib`
  requests regardless of User-Agent, the bot-shape filter
  fingerprints on TLS / JA3 / HTTP/2 framing, not just the UA. The
  widget now prefers the warm `BrowserPool`'s `fetch_text` (Chromium's
  real fingerprint) and falls back to `urllib` only when the pool is
  off or the Playwright fetch fails. Each pool fetch uses a fresh
  incognito context so cookies don't accumulate.
- `BrowserPool` gains a generic `fetch_text(FetchRequest)` method
  alongside `render(RenderRequest)` so other widgets hitting flaky
  upstreams can opt in without touching the renderer code.

## [0.11.4], 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Docker self-update awareness.** The Settings → System "Updates"
  card now does the right thing inside the official container: hits
  GitHub's release API (with a `/tags` fallback for repos that don't
  publish Releases yet) to show whether a newer version is out, and
  surfaces a copy-pasteable `docker compose pull && docker compose up
  -d` instead of the git-based "Apply update" button. Result is cached
  for an hour to stay under GitHub's 60/hr anonymous rate limit. Source
  installs keep the existing git-pull / re-exec self-updater.

## [0.11.3], 2026-06-01

### Changed

- **Cache-busting on every static asset.** `url_for('static', …)` now
  auto-appends `?v=<version>` via a `url_defaults` hook, so a shipped
  JS / CSS change picks up on a soft reload instead of needing
  `Cmd+Shift+R`. In prod the suffix is the app version (busts on every
  release); in `--dev` it's `<version>-<startup-ts>` so each dev restart
  also breaks the cache (useful when iterating on client.js / .css).
- App version is now resolved once in `create_app` and exposed via
  `app.config["APP_VERSION"]` for reuse by telemetry and the static-
  asset cache buster, with pyproject.toml taking precedence over
  `importlib.metadata` (the source-checkout vs. installed-wheel split
  already shipped in 0.11.2).

## [0.11.2], 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Telemetry was reporting the wrong version.** The app version sent in
  `appVersion` / `sdkVersion` came from `importlib.metadata.version("tesserae")`,
  which reads frozen wheel metadata, so an `-e .` install kept reporting
  whatever pyproject.toml said at the last `pip install`, even if the
  version got bumped on disk after. Source checkouts now read
  `pyproject.toml` directly; installed wheels still fall back to
  `importlib.metadata`.
- **Events page timestamps are now human-readable** (`Jun 1 14:23:45`,
  local time) on both the server-rendered rows and the live SSE stream.
  The machine-readable ISO timestamp stays in the `<time datetime="…">`
  attribute for accessibility.

## [0.11.1], 2026-06-01

### Changed

- `github_repo`, tightened the four directions to match an updated
  handoff for the repo card specifically:
  - RE1 (Refined): repo name stays lowercase; stat row is hairlines now
    (no solid-colour tiles), and description carries inline lang +
    license chips.
  - RE2 (Geometric): added the slim paper description strip between the
    green header and the language strip.
  - RE3 (Swiss): repo name lowercase + bold (not uppercase); stats
    swapped from dots to small squares; numerals are light-weight (300);
    ink bars fill the bottom more densely.
  - RE4 (Data): repo name lowercase; left column is now a vertical
    language list (row per language, distributed to fill the column)
    instead of a wrapped legend.

## [0.11.0], 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Four visual directions per GitHub widget.** `github_activity`,
  `github_actions`, `github_contributions`, `github_pr_queue`, and
  `github_repo` each ship four selectable looks from a Bauhaus / Swiss
  handoff: Refined (charcoal `DarkHeader` + solid stat tiles), Geometric
  (De Stijl colour blocks), Swiss / International (hairlines only), and
  Data (donut + bars + outlined tiles). Pick per cell via the new
  `variant` option.

### Changed

- GitHub widgets map the design's categorical accent palette (green /
  red / yellow / blue / ink / muted) to `--c-data-2` / `--c-accent` /
  `--c-data-3` / `--c-data-4` / `--c-text` / `--c-text-soft` -
  intentionally NOT `--c-ok` / `--c-warn` / `--c-danger`, since the
  GitHub accents code identity, not semantic status.

## [0.10.1], 2026-06-01

### Changed

- `ha_climate`: dropped a dead `transparent` fallback on
  `var(--c-bg)`, the semantic token is always defined on the cell
  host, so the fallback never fired. Cosmetic; no behaviour change.

## [0.10.0], 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Six visual directions per Home Assistant widget.** `ha_climate`,
  `ha_entities`, `ha_history`, and `ha_sensor` each ship six selectable
  looks from a Bauhaus / Swiss handoff: Refined, Geometric (De Stijl),
  Swiss / International, Data (Gauge Dial / Meters / Chart / Ring
  Gauges), Editorial / Editorial Ledger, and Glanceable. Pick per cell
  via the new `variant` option. State→colour (heat/cool/ok/warn/idle)
  is derived from each entity's current action/value and maps to the
  theme's `--c-*` semantic tokens, so every Tesserae theme restyles
  cleanly across colour, mono, and neon.

## [0.9.0], 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Six visual directions per calendar widget.** `calendar_day`,
  `calendar_week`, and `calendar_month` each ship six selectable looks
  pulled from a Bauhaus / Swiss design handoff: Refined, Geometric,
  Swiss / International, Timeline / Agenda Split, Editorial, and
  Glanceable / Dot Density. Pick per cell via the new `variant` option.
  Each direction maps cleanly onto the theme's `--c-*` tokens, so the
  same widget restyles across colour, mono, and neon themes without
  hard-coded hex. Per-event colour comes from the feed configured in
  *Plugins → Calendar Feeds*.

## [0.8.3], 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Six monochrome themes** for 1-bit panels (Paper, Carbon, Newsprint,
  Halftone, Ash, Graphite). Designed for the Kindle / native TRMNL
  rendering pipeline, Paper / Carbon are flat for sharp text, Newsprint
  / Halftone are halftone-friendly for printed-page texture, Ash /
  Graphite sit between as softer alternatives.
- **`tags` field on themes** to support family grouping. The theme
  picker on the page editor now groups by family in `<optgroup>`s, so
  the six mono themes cluster together, someone setting up a Kindle
  dashboard can spot them without scrolling past 20 colour themes.

## [0.8.2], 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- TRMNL discovery headers are case-insensitive, so KOReader's
  `Png-Width` / `Png-Height` (Title-case) land as `panel_w` / `panel_h`
  in the cache and pre-fill the Register form, previously they only
  matched the lowercase / native-TRMNL spellings and were silently
  dropped.

### Changed

- README updated with a "TRMNL-compatible (HTTP pull)" panels subsection;
  Kindle Paperwhite 2 (jailbroken, KOReader trmnl-display plugin) listed
  as tested.

## [0.8.1], 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Scheduler skips schedules whose target page was deleted instead of
  letting them fire every tick and log "page not found" to the History
  view. Warns once per session per stale schedule so the operator sees
  something actionable in the log without spam.
- Schedules editor flags stale schedules with a red "page deleted" pill
  + a subtle row tint, so the user can rebind or delete them.

## [0.8.0], 2026-05-31

TRMNL HTTP-pull compatibility lets a jailbroken Kindle (running the
KOReader trmnl-display plugin) or any native TRMNL hardware paint a
Tesserae-managed dashboard alongside the existing MQTT-push Pi / ESP32
panels. Plus a stale-discovery sweep on HA start so deleted device
tiles stop ghosting Home Assistant.

### Added

- **TRMNL BYOS protocol.** New `trmnl_client` device kind, `trmnl_png`
  renderer (greyscale + 1-bit quantise), and `/api/display` /
  `/api/setup` / `/api/log` HTTP blueprint authed by per-device 5-char
  access tokens. Onboarded clients show up in the existing *Discovered*
  strip with panel dims pre-filled; tokens are short on purpose so they
  can be typed into clients without a keyboard.
- **Per-device Display name** field on the Settings card; saving
  re-publishes Home Assistant discovery so the HA device tile title
  updates without a Tesserae restart.

### Changed

- TRMNL device heartbeats (request headers) feed the same
  `DEVICE_STATUS` cache + HA discovery path as MQTT clients, so battery
  / signal / IP sensors appear in HA for TRMNL panels too.
- `latest_render_for(device_id)` on `PushManager` is now persisted to
  `data/core/latest_renders.json` so fresh polls after a restart don't
  serve placeholders.

### Fixed

- HA discovery orphan sweep on start, retained discovery configs for
  devices deleted while Tesserae was offline get blanked, so HA stops
  showing ghost device tiles forever.

## [0.7.0], 2026-05-30

Docker shipped, Settings got a refactor + a complete picture-quality
control surface, and themes were curated down from a sprawl to 25
deliberate variants.

### Added

- **Official Docker image + compose** publishing to GHCR. Host
  networking by default (so mDNS and broker discovery work without YAML
  edits); `TESSERAE_HOST_IP` env-var surfaces the right LAN IP in
  render URLs when running bridged.
- **Per-device picture quality** controls (dither / saturation /
  contrast) on the device card; per-device renderer clones inherit
  their fleet's averaged defaults on creation.
- **Curated theme set**, 25 named themes across light, dark, and neon
  families, with a dev-only widget-gallery theme picker.

### Changed

- `app/main.py` split into `app_factory` + `transport_wiring`;
  `settings_routes.py` split into the `app/settings/` package.
- README trimmed; depth lives in the MkDocs wiki.

### Fixed

- Portrait rotation actually rotates (was no-op'd by a wrong axis swap).
- Docker entrypoint chowns `/app/data` then drops privileges via
  `gosu`.
- Safari login auto-save works (hidden username field on setup + login).

## [0.6.0], 2026-05-30

Quiet hours, webhooks, per-device timetable, and a stack of embedded-
broker fixes.

### Added

- **Quiet hours**, suppress automated pushes during a configurable
  window, with a per-device override in Settings → Devices.
- **Webhook push API**, `POST /api/v1/push` for external automation
  (Home Assistant, n8n, etc.).
- **Per-device Timetable card**, read-only view of which schedules
  reach this display, sorted by next-fire.
- **Modal webhook-token reveal** so the secret isn't pasted into the
  Settings form.

### Changed

- Device card saves all subsections via one "Save changes" button.
- Collapsible device cards keep the Settings page scannable when the
  fleet grows.

### Fixed

- Embedded broker rebuilt against `amqtt` 0.11 (auth + system topics
  restored).
- "Test broker connect" works for the built-in broker.
- Send page auto-ticks the only registered device instead of erroring
  on submit.

## [0.5.0], 2026-05-30

Onboarding polish + recording infrastructure for the docs.

### Added

- Panel-size picker on the onboarding device step.
- Playwright-driven recording scripts for the onboarding + dashboard
  flows (used to generate the docs GIFs).

### Changed

- Telemetry consent copy softened on the onboarding step.

## [0.4.0], 2026-05-30

Anonymous opt-in telemetry (Aptabase) and the Windows port. Several
quick follow-ups to align with Aptabase's wire format and fix Windows
self-restart.

### Added

- **Anonymous opt-in telemetry.** Off by default; `app.started` and
  `update.applied` events sent to a self-hosted Aptabase instance with
  no PII. Consent prompt added to onboarding.
- Test-event button in the System tab + telemetry attempts surfaced in
  the Events tab.
- Pre-push hook that nudges when `pyproject.toml` hasn't been bumped.

### Fixed

- Aptabase wire format: `isDebug` must be a bool, SDK version must be
  `name@version` (0.4.3).
- Windows self-restart no longer hangs, replaces `os.execv` with
  `Popen + os._exit + parent-pid handshake` (0.4.4).
- Every `Path.read_text` / `Path.write_text` pinned to
  `encoding="utf-8"` so Windows doesn't mangle em-dashes (0.4.8).
- Reloader-watcher process no longer double-inits MQTT, scheduler, and
  telemetry in dev mode (0.4.8).

## [0.3.0], 2026-05-30

A System tab (self-update + backup/restore), the `--c-*` semantic theme
token layer used by every widget, an event-log dedup, and the MkDocs
wiki scaffold.

### Added

- **Settings → System**, self-update from a GitHub tag, full data
  backup/restore (zips `data/` minus user-controlled exclusions like
  the picture-gallery cache).
- **MkDocs wiki** under `docs/` with auto-generated widget gallery and
  compatibility tables; deploys to GitHub Pages.
- **mDNS advertiser**, opt-in `tesserae.local` (and
  `tesserae-dev.local` in `--dev`).
- **Per-push image-fit picker** on the Send page with an accurate live
  preview.
- **Spotify Now Playing** gains five selectable layout variants.

### Changed

- Theme system now exposes a `--c-*` semantic token layer; every widget
  reads from it instead of raw palette tokens, so a single theme switch
  updates the whole dashboard.
- Event log caps device-status rows separately from push events and
  skips unchanged heartbeats, so the log stays useful at high panel
  count.
- MQTT default client id is per-host so multiple Tesserae instances on
  the same broker don't reconnect-loop.

### Fixed

- `news_reddit` widget reads the RSS feed, Reddit's `.json` endpoint
  now 403-blocks unauthenticated clients.

## [0.2.0], 2026-05-28

First release aimed at fellow hobbyists: multi-panel support is built
in throughout, the widget catalogue is broad, and a fresh clone of each
reference client works against the server defaults with no manual topic
editing.

### Multi-head devices (headline)

- **Device instances.** Register multiple physical panels in
  Settings → Devices, each with its own id, MQTT topics, and panel size.
  A built-in *kind* is a template; each panel you add is an *instance* of
  a kind. Per-instance add / edit-panel / delete, all hot-reloaded, no
  restart.
- **Per-page targeting.** Bind a dashboard to a specific device; it sizes
  to that panel and pushes only to its renderers. Unbound pages fan out
  to every renderer at the virtual-panel size (the renamed global panel
  fallback).
- **Auto-discovery.** The server listens on `tesserae/+/status`; any
  client publishing a heartbeat for an unregistered id shows up in a
  *Discovered* strip with its kind and panel size pre-filled, for
  one-click registration.
- **Orientation calibration.** Push a numbered test card to a panel, say
  which number landed in the top-left, and the orientation is set for
  you. Manual rotation (0 / 90 / 180 / 270°) is a single dropdown.
- **Send-page device picker** on the File / URL / Webpage tabs routes a
  manual push to one display.

### Breaking changes

- The `pi_client` device kind split into **`pi_bin_client`** (topic
  prefix `pi_bin`) and **`pi_png_client`** (prefix `pi_png`). Default
  topics moved from `tesserae/pi/...` to `tesserae/pi_bin/...` /
  `tesserae/pi_png/...`. Update clients to the new defaults (the
  reference clients already are), or set `device_id = "pi"` explicitly to
  keep the old prefix.
- MQTT grammar is now `tesserae/<device-id>/<channel>[/<format>]`, where
  `<device-id>` is the per-device topic prefix.

### Widgets

- ~40 widgets across weather, F1, calendar, news, finance, GitHub,
  clocks, sky, pictures, todo, and Melbourne public transport, each with
  a documented [stability tier](README.md#widget-stability-tiers).
- New since 0.1.0 include the full weather / news / finance / GitHub /
  calendar / sky / pictures families, analog & word clocks, and a
  `webpage` screenshot widget.

### Editor & themes

- Interactive layout editor: drag-resize, insert, and delete cells, with
  auto-save and click-to-edit live preview.
- Theme builder with live preview, image-to-theme palette extraction
  (k-means + token assignment), and an eyedropper.
- Dashboard icon picker (Phosphor), dark-mode toggle, mobile-responsive
  admin.

### Install & ops

- One-liner installer for macOS / Linux / Raspberry Pi (`install.sh`) and
  Windows (`install.ps1`), with interactive port selection and a Chromium
  fallback for platforms Playwright doesn't ship a binary for.
- Ships under [waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/)
  by default; `--dev` opts into the Flask reloader.
- CI runs ruff + pytest + mypy `--strict` (on contract modules) on every
  push.

### Reference clients (separate repos)

- [tesserae-device-pi-bin](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-pi-bin)
 , default id `pi_bin`.
- [tesserae-device-pi-png](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-pi-png)
 , default id `pi_png`.
- [tesserae-device-esp32-bin](https://github.com/dmellok/tesserae-device-esp32-bin)
 , default id `esp32`, device id set via captive portal.

All three publish discovery hints (`kind`, `panel_w`, `panel_h`,
`fw_version`) so they auto-register on the server.

## [0.1.0], 2026-05-26

Initial milestone build: plugin / renderer / device loaders, composer,
MQTT transport + push pipeline, manifest-driven settings with an auth
gate, scheduler, Send page, generalised event log, and Home Assistant
MQTT discovery.
