"""Shared next-poll decision for HTTP-polled e-paper clients.

Two request paths ask the same question and want the same answer:

* ``app.rest_api`` — the v1 REST client protocol. ``POST
  /api/v1/device/<id>/status`` echoes ``next_poll_s``.
* ``app.trmnl_api`` — the TRMNL BYOS protocol. ``GET /api/display``
  echoes ``refresh_rate``.

The answer: the device's configured wake interval is the ceiling (the
staleness the operator signed up for, and the only cover for the update
causes that can't be projected — manual Send, webhooks, HA events).
Within that, the soonest *known* change pulls the wake earlier so the
client lands on the new frame; wake alignment reshapes the ceiling onto a
wall-clock grid; and a device inside a quiet window it asked to sleep
through is told to sleep until the window reopens.

Historically this lived in ``app.rest_api`` and only the REST path had
it; ``app.trmnl_api`` echoed the static configured value. This module is
that logic, lifted out so both paths stay in lockstep.

Everything here needs a Flask **app** context (it reads ``SCHEDULER``,
``SETTINGS_STORE``, ``PUSH_MANAGER`` and ``DEVICE_TELEMETRY`` off
``current_app.config``) but no request context. Every external
dependency is wrapped so a fault degrades to the configured interval
rather than stranding a device.
