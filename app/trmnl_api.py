"""HTTP API for TRMNL-compatible clients.

TRMNL clients (jailbroken Kindles running the KOReader trmnl-display
plugin, TRMNL devices, any BYOS-compatible client) poll
``GET /api/display`` on a fixed cadence and paint whatever PNG the
server hands back. Authentication is a per-device ``access-token``
header, the user generates it in Tesserae's Settings → Devices and
pastes it into the client's config. No MAC, no pairing flow, no MQTT.

Three endpoints:

* ``GET /api/display``, polled by every client on every wake. Returns
  ``{image_url, filename, refresh_rate, ...}`` pointing at the latest
  rendered frame for the device. Also captures the client's status
  headers (battery, RSSI, panel dims, firmware version) into the same
  ``DEVICE_STATUS`` cache the MQTT devices feed, so Settings → Devices
  shows freshness + battery uniformly.

* ``GET /api/setup/``, first-boot flow. Native TRMNL clients call it
  to exchange a MAC for a token; the KOReader plugin skips it. We
  respond with whatever token the request brought (or a generated one
  if pairing-style discovery makes sense later) so the client doesn't
  give up.

* ``POST /api/log/``, optional client-side diagnostics. Native TRMNLs
  use it; the KOReader plugin doesn't. We accept anything, log the
  body, and return 200.

Until the renderer + per-device latest-render map land, ``/api/display``
returns a server-generated test pattern at the client's requested
dimensions (read from ``png-width`` / ``png-height`` headers, like the
recon server). That keeps the flow demonstrable end-to-end while the
production pipeline integration comes together.
